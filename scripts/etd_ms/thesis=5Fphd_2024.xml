        <etd_ms:description>The extensive use of electric vehicles (EVs) provides energy-critical infrastructures with some advantages and drawbacks at the same time. The large-scale deployment of EVs can improve the reliability and efficiency of the power grid through, for instance, bidirectional energy transfers between grids and EVs, reduction in electricity bills, and ancillary services. The majority of these advantages are enabled by the use of communication and information technologies (ICTs) in the EV infrastructures and their associated smart power grids. Moreover, EV supplies equipment (EVSE) network, e.g., charging stations, including a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smartphone applications that facilitate the charging process for users. However, such a broad deployment of cyber devices and information technologies makes the EV ecosystem prone to cyber-attacks in the form of data manipulation, malware, and intrusions. The attacks against public and private EV charging stations, which are often designed without security concerns in mind, are threats against owners and can lead to complicated security issues for smart grids. Additionally, compromising the security of these large-scale EV infrastructures can propagate into the wide-area transmission power grid, cause resonance events, and result in instability and even blackouts. Studying potentially vulnerable points in the EV ecosystems that adversaries can exploit to impact the stability of power grids, and suggesting proper detection and mitigation strategies is of paramount importance. Finally, designing security metrics for distribution and transmission systems can assist power grid utilities in informing about the power grid security status in the presence of attacks originating from EV ecosystems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Soup City: A Bricolage Methodology to Navigate the Complexity of Homelessness Across Macro-Policy and Micro-Local Spaces</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Abdalreza Zadeh, Mohammad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>We cannot address a social problem like homelessness holistically without understanding its complexity. While homelessness is a complex social construct with a wide range of parameters, dynamic interactions, and a high level of uncertainty, two profound disconnects exist at the macro-policy and micro-local levels in approaching the problem. Macro-policy level decision-makers, including politicians and policymakers, wield influence over legislative frameworks and resource allocations that shape national or regional responses to homelessness. In stark contrast, the micro-local level amplifies the voices of unhoused individuals, grassroots organizations, social workers, and community advocates who confront homelessness directly within their local contexts. In this PhD journey, I explore the common ground between macro-policy and micro-local approaches to make sense of the complex nature of homelessness. Grounded in the theories of space and complexity, I conduct a multi-theoretical approach, bricolage, to collage the fragmented pieces of policy and local levels together and synthesize them creatively. At the macro-policy level, in a co-authored paper, I delved into narrations of homelessness among thirty-eight members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) through a Chronotropic lens. The findings reveal the dynamism, diversity, and assortment of dimensions related to time, space, and body in the analyzed narratives, highlighting five main perspectives: viewing homelessness as an issue of security, vulnerability, quantification, inclusivity, and human rights. At the micro-local level, I had a transformational journey with Le Collectif Comm-Un, a grassroots organization built on the cornerstones of self-advocacy, healing, and community engagement to approach homelessness in the Milton-Parc neighborhood of Montréal. Applying a heuristic lens, I observed that my one-and-a-half-year engagement with the Le Collectif Comm-Un community shifted my focus from understanding homelessness to examining the sick society I come from. My dialogic Comm-Un experience illuminated homelessness as a form of protest against the dominant political-economic system, capitalism, which reproduces everyday social injustice.

Finally, conducting a comparative analysis of findings from macro-policy and micro-local investigations, I found that the common ground between policy and local scales is a space characterized by heterogeneity, dynamism, and uncertainty, requiring collective praxis and interdisciplinary approaches. This space incorporates dualities like objectivity/subjectivity, formality/informality, individual/social, fixed/dynamic, vulnerability/human rights, and social identity/human interaction. Using theories of Carnival, embedded design, and insights from the Comm-Un community, I conceptualized this common ground, embracing all the dualities, with an imaginary spatial concept called Soup City. In Soup City, different actors from various levels of the macro-policy and micro-local spectrum meet to build human connection, suspend social hierarchies, decentralize knowledge production, challenge social norms, celebrate the power of community, and fuse their diverse intentions, resources, ideas, power positions, knowledge, strategies, worldviews, and stories. I, as a bricoleur and Comm-Un member, represent the Soup City space as a social game and art-informed participatory action research method for understanding the complexity of homelessness. I argue that we cannot make sense of the problem of homelessness without ongoing collective defining the problem, collective imagination, collective planning, collective action, and collective evaluation. No one can define and end homelessness except everyone. It takes a village!</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Flow Characteristics of Transitions in Open Channels</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Al Kayed, Mustafa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Warped transition; honeycomb; control of turbulence; secondary flow; acoustic Doppler velocimetry measurements; flow separation.</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>The characteristics of turbulence in open-channel transitions have important implications for hydraulic engineering. This study considers a warped transition that links a rectangular channel section with a relatively large trapezoidal channel section. The change in cross-sectional shape as well as area causes an adverse pressure gradient. As a result, the primary flow separates from the transition sidewalls, turbulence eddies form, and losses of flow energy occur; these conditions reduce hydraulic efficiency and are highly undesirable. Previous researchers have made great efforts to reduce energy losses and improve hydraulic efficiency but have not addressed the issues adequately. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of introducing a honeycomb with small open cells to the transition in order to improve the flow characteristics. This study took an experimental approach. Three-dimensional instantaneous velocities were measured using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. An analysis of the measurements produced cross-sectional distributions of the longitudinal flow velocity, secondary flow, turbulence kinetic energy, and Reynolds shear stress. The energy losses were determined, and they were compared between the case of a plain warped transition (without a honeycomb) and the case with a honeycomb. The presence of the honeycomb in the transition improved the flow characteristics, reducing flow separation, energy losses, and turbulence strength. The honeycomb helped increase flow uniformity and decrease the maximum velocity in the transition and farther downstream. A potential benefit of a decreased maximum velocity is a decreased risk of channel erosion. The honeycomb worked to prevent the formation of large turbulent eddies that are known to be energy-bearing while avoiding excessive frictional losses of flow energy because the contact area of the passing fluids with the open cells is small. The mechanism at work is that the small open cells effectively limit the size of the largest possible turbulent eddies while distributing the approach flow evenly across the width of the transition. For practical application, a honeycomb can easily be installed at the entrance of a new or existing transition for beneficial effects. This study has contributed to improving the design of irrigation, drainage, and hydropower channels, all of which typically need a transition.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Optimized Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Target Search and Localization</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Alagha, Ahmed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In a world that increasingly relies on autonomous systems, swarm robotics hold the promise of revolutionizing how complex tasks, such as target search and localization, are approached. The ability of multiple autonomous agents, such as robots and UAVs, to work together, exchange information, and adapt to dynamic environments is critical for target localization applications ranging from search and rescue missions to environmental monitoring. However, efficiently coordinating a swarm of robots to search for targets in uncertain and complex environments poses significant challenges. Most existing solutions for target search and localization still possess challenges and limitations in terms of adaptability to different environments and scalability. These challenges become even more intricate when the target may not exist (i.e. false alarms) or is unreachable.

In this thesis, the main motivation is to leverage AI, specifically Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MDRL), to address the target search and localization problem. The aim is to develop MDRL solutions where the agents intelligently and autonomously learn to tackle the problem and its different complexities, with minimum human intervention. The capacity of MDRL in producing agents capable of learning from their experiences in the environment proves efficient in handling complex and dynamic scenarios, such as coordinating with other agents, translating data readings into actions that lead to the target, and navigating obstacles in the environment. This research is motivated by four main needs: (1) Adaptable solutions for collaborative target search and localization for varying environment complexities; (2) autonomous and intelligent sensing agents with decision-making that addresses scenarios like false alarms and target unreachability; (3) scalable and efficient AI-based learning process for the sensing agents, and (4) mechanisms for knowledge exchange across different users and parties from different domains for better accessibility to AI solutions.

The aforementioned needs are addressed in this thesis by: (1) Developing novel MDRL algorithms for collaborative target search in both simple and cluttered environments by modeling the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), (2) designing novel methods based on ideas from MDRL, Imitation Learning (IL), and reward shaping for enhanced and quick learning performance, (3) enhancing the proposed MDRL algorithms by integrating complex decision-making, where agents can take actions ranging from mobility to deciding on the existence and reachability of the target, (4) developing a blockchain-based platform for Deep Reinforcement Learning as a Service (DRLaaS) allowing collaborative training and better accessibility to DRL solutions for target localization problems, and (5) ensuring the scalability of all the proposed solutions through the use of concepts such as Centralized-Learning and Distributed Execution (CLDE) MDRL methods coupled with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for optimized analysis of the agents' collected observations. Besides these contributions, we present several experimental studies and simulations that validate the proposed methods and compare them against existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in the literature.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>In-plane Cyclic Response of Flexural-Dominated Partially Grouted Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls with Boundary Elements</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Alahdal, Abdulelah</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Masonry shear walls, fully grouted, partially grouted, cyclic loading, boundary elements</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Reinforced masonry shear walls (RMSWs) are commonly used in seismic regions, but predicting their behaviour is challenging due to the composite nature of materials like masonry blocks, mortar, steel rebars, and grout. This complexity is heightened in partially grouted (PG) walls, where stiffness discontinuities occur at interfaces between grouted and ungrouted cells. The scarcity of experimental data on the materials’ properties has further complicated the development of accurate analytical models.
This research aims to enhance the lateral performance of PG masonry shear walls and develop a reliable analytical model. The study is divided into two main Phases: analytical and experimental. In the analytical phase (Phase I), a nonlinear finite element model was developed and validated against experimental data from the literature. Due to the lack of material properties in existing studies, assumptions were made to fill these gaps. The model generated a comprehensive matrix of 196 numerical models, covering a wide range of parameters such as aspect ratio, spacing between grouted cells, axial load, reinforcement ratios, and grouted and ungrouted compressive strengths. In the experimental phase (Phase II), 84 masonry prisms were tested to evaluate the compressive, shear, and tensile properties of grouted, ungrouted, and boundary element masonry assemblages. Consequently, using these components, two half-scale PG shear wall specimens with C-shaped boundary elements were constructed and tested under high axial loads and in-plane cyclic loading. These tests represented the lower storey of RMSWs in of a six- and twelve-storey buildings and examined the impact of full versus partial grouting and aspect ratios. 
The analytical investigation resulted in three penta-linear load-displacement backbone models for flexural-dominated, shear-dominated, and combined failure modes, along with secant stiffness expressions for each wall type. These models were validated against additional data, showing good accuracy for PG walls. The study also identified the inadequacy of the stiffness reduction factor in CSA S304-14 for PG walls, leading to the derivation of new coefficients. The experimental results provided detailed stress-strain data for various mechanical properties, and wall tests showed ductile performance with high energy dissipation, exceeding North American design standards before strength degradation began.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Computational Geometry and Online Algorithms</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ali, Mohammad Lavasani</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores several problems in computational geometry and online algorithms,
focusing on efficient algorithms for geometric optimization and real-time decision-making. We
begin by addressing the offline computational geometry problem of the Maximum Weighted
Convex Polytope (MWCP), followed by two online algorithmic problems: Online Non-Crossing
Matching and Online Interval Scheduling.
In the MWCP problem, the goal is to find a convex polytope within a set of n weighted (positive
and negative) points in R^d that maximizes the total weight of points inside or on the boundary.
We present a new simple algorithm for the two-dimensional case, achieving the same time
complexity of O(n^3) as previous methods. We also prove that MWCP is NP-hard in dimensions
three or higher, even when weights are restricted to +1 and -1, and that in dimensions four or
higher, the problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of n^{1/2-epsilon}.
We next focus on the Online Non-Crossing Matching problem, where points arrive sequentially
in the plane and must be irrevocably matched to previously arrived points such that the resulting
matched pairs form non-crossing line segments. We introduce the weighted version of this
problem, aiming to maximize the total weight of matched pairs. We show that deterministic
algorithms can have arbitrarily bad competitive ratios due to adversarial weight assignments. To
address this, we consider weights within the range [1, U] and provide an algorithm with a
competitive ratio of Omega (2^{-2 sqrt{ log U }}), along with an upper bound of O(2^{-sqrt{log
U}}) for any deterministic algorithm. In the setting that allows revoking, we develop an algorithm
that achieves a competitive ratio of approximately 0.28, and prove that no deterministic
algorithm can exceed a competitive ratio of 2/3, even in the unweighted case. Additionally, we
propose a randomized algorithm with a competitive ratio of 1/3, and show that no randomized
algorithm can surpass a competitive ratio of 8/9 in the unweighted case.
We also study the advice complexity of this problem. We establish a lower bound of (n/3) - 1 on
the advice complexity and provide an algorithm that uses approximately 2n bits of advice,
matching log C_n, where C_n is the n th Catalan number. Furthermore, we derive a lower
bound on the advice complexity required to achieve a competitive ratio in (16/17, 1). In the
bichromatic version of this problem, where a set of n blue points are given offline and red points
arrive online to be matched only to blue points, we correct previous errors in the literature and
establish a lower bound of log C_n on the advice complexity. We also present an algorithm that
uses log C_n bits of advice when points arrive in convex position.
In the final part, we consider the Online Interval Selection problem when the interval graph of
the input is a simple path, allowing revoking of previous decisions. We show that under the
random-order model, a deterministic memoryless algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of
approximately 0.78. We also established an upper bound of 3/4 for any deterministic revoking

algorithm on a simple chain in the adversarial model, and a lower bound of n/4 for the advice
complexity of Online Interval Selection, marking the first lower bound for this problem.
Throughout this work, we develop novel algorithmic techniques, establish tight complexity
bounds, and provide new insights into advice complexity for key problems in computational
geometry and online algorithms. These contributions aim to advance the theoretical foundations
of these fields and have potential applications in real-time systems and geometric data analysis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Novel Convolutional Neural Network Pore-Based Fingerprint Recognition System</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ali, Mohammed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Biometrics play an important role in security measures, such as border control and online transactions, relying on traits like uniqueness and permanence. Among the different biometrics, the fingerprint stands out for their enduring nature and individual uniqueness. Fingerprint recognition systems traditionally rely on ridge patterns (Level 1) and minutiae (Level 2). However, these systems suffer from recognition accuracy with partial fingerprints. Level 3 features, such as pores, offer distinctive attributes crucial for individual identification, particularly with high-resolution acquisition devices. Moreover, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has significantly improved the accuracy in automatic feature extraction for biometric recognition.

A CNN-based pore fingerprint recognition system consists of two main modules, pore detection and pore feature extraction and matching modules. The first module generates pixel intensity maps to determine the pore centroids, while the second module extracts relevant features of pores to generate pore representations for matching between query and template fingerprints. However, existing CNN architectures lack in generating deep-level discriminative feature and computational efficiency. Moreover, available knowledge on the pores has not been taken into consideration optimally for pore centroids and metrics other than Euclidean distance have not been explored for pore matching.

The objective of this research is to develop a CNN-based pore fingerprint recognition scheme that is capable of providing a low-complexity and high-accuracy performance. The design of the CNN architecture of the two modules aimed at generating features at different hierarchical levels in residual frameworks and fusing them to produce comprehensive sets of discriminative features. Depthwise and depthwise separable convolution operations are judiciously used to keep the complexity of networks low. In the proposed pore centroid part, the knowledge of the variation of the pore characteristics is used. In the proposed pore matching scheme, a composite metric, encompassing the Euclidean distance, angle, and magnitudes difference between the vectors of pore representations, is proposed to measure the similarity between the pores in the query and template images.

Extensive experiments are performed on fingerprint images from the benchmark PolyU High-Resolution-Fingerprint dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the various strategies developed and used in the proposed scheme for fingerprint recognition.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Modelling Neuron-Glial Network Interactions at the Whole-Brain Scale for Human Neuroimaging Applications</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Glial cells, together with their neighboring neurons, constitute an integral functional unit within brain circuitry, rather than isolated elements. Astrocytes, for instance, are strategically situated around neurons and profoundly modulate neuronal circuits. They achieve this by forming gap-junction networks that actively monitor and regulate synaptic and extrasynaptic transmission of glutamate and GABA. Consequently, recent neuroscientific research firmly proposes that our understanding of brain function should incorporate a neuron-glial perspective. This approach necessitates an in-depth comprehension of neuron-glial interactions and emphasizes the critical role of computational modelling, which is essential due to the inherent nonlinearity and multiscale nature of these interactions. Despite this recognition, there is a notable deficiency in computational frameworks that elaborate on the neuron-glial perspective, particularly at the whole-brain level. This thesis addresses this significant gap.
The objective of this thesis is to underscore the significance of neuron-glial network interactions to whole-brain computational processes, particularly at the scale relevant to neuroimaging data. It conceptualizes the brain as a dynamic network-of-networks, wherein glial assemblies and neuronal populations communicate via various channels (mediated by glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission systems) and across diverse spatiotemporal scales, with structural constraints imposed by gap-junctional and axonal densities. The thesis introduces a biophysically plausible dynamical model of neuron-glial network interactions at the whole-brain scale, employing neural mass network and compartmental modelling techniques. It reveals how glial networks contribute to whole-brain activity and the emergence of functional connectivity patterns, using simulations grounded in multilayer network and dynamic system theories. The thesis further presents two neuroimaging applications. The first elucidates the influence of glial networks in the non-invasive electrophysiological reconstruction of resting-state functional networks. This offers a biologically informed computational framework to refine and assess empirical methodologies in whole-brain electrophysiological connectomics. The second generates credible mechanistic hypotheses for large-scale network dysfunctions, resistance, and adaptations in brains afflicted by Alzheimer disease. This aims to inform potential empirical investigations.
This timely thesis represents a critical step towards resolving longstanding neuron-glial questions through computational approaches, setting a foundation for an era where real-world experimentation and computational modeling mutually inform and advance our understanding of the brain.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Interfacial Behavior and 2D Self-Assembly of Heteroatom-Doped
π-Conjugated Surfactants</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The intrinsic photophysical properties of heteroatom-doped π-conjugated systems, which are essential for optimal electronic performance, necessitate the formation of well-ordered 2D thin films with structural stability. These thin films can be achieved by self-assembly using Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) techniques. Manipulation of molecular design and external conditions is explored to achieve controlled film morphology desirable for electronic applications. In this context, two classes of amphiphilic heteroatom-doped π-conjugated compounds are explored: phosphole-lipids and amphiphilic tetraazaporphyrins (TAPs). 
Introduction of counterions to Langmuir films of phosphole-based lipids with charged dithienophospholium backbone showed that incorporation of halide salts significantly influences the intercalation between phosphole headgroups, thereby stabilizing monolayers and promoting the formation of well-ordered structures free from 3D aggregates. However, only the counterions with their size matching the space restriction in between the headgroups enhance the film organization and facilitate the desired monolayer formation. Characterization techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) confirm the formation of condensed phase and highlight the presence of hexagonally packed chains. Exploring the effects of aromatic additives on film structure of the same phosphole-lipids demonstrates that while such additives can influence the growth patterns and organization of 2D films, challenges remain in eliminating aggregate formation.
For the amphiphilic tetraazaporphyrins featuring octaalkylthio substitution, we focused on the influence of varying alkyl chain lengths on film morphology and orientation. Notably, TAPs with shorter alkyl chains yield homogeneous monolayers with spider-like conformation where the macrocycle is oriented face-on to the substrate. GIXD confirmed that the packing is not dominated by the pentyl chains, but rather by the organization of the rings (in a molecular lattice), resulting in an ordered condensed phase. However, TAPs with longer chains exhibit complex, inhomogeneous LB films with combination of spider-like and interdigitated conformations observed by AFM, the latter attributed to the larger alkyl chains and confirmed by GIXD.
The findings of this research underscore the importance of tuning both molecular structure and external conditions to optimize the self-assembly of π-conjugated materials to enhance structural complexity and improve the functionality of the developed materials.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Models and Algorithms for Concept Drift Detection, Adaptation, and Resolution in Streaming Data</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Alizadeh Mansouri, Ali</etd_ms:creator>

        <etd_ms:description>The evolution of streaming data during long periods of time presents significant challenges for maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of predictive models due to concept drift — where changes in data distribution can lead to performance degradation. In this research, we study the problems of concept drift detection (CDD) and adaptation (CDA). Unlike traditional approaches that treat CDD and CDA independently and in isolation, often under non-streaming, static conditions, we propose a novel methodology based on multivariate vector error-correction analysis of feature importance measures (FIMs). The FIMs provided a solid foundation that allowed us to reformulate concept drift detection and adaptation in streaming data.

We additionally introduce, formalize, and develop the notion of concept drift resolution (CDR) as an innovative model preference technique. This solution further enhances the overall performance by effectively using multiple models undergoing concept drift, including the main learner and the proposed CDA model. The results of our numerous experiments and analyses indicate that the proposed CDD method significantly reduces computation time, particularly in applications experiencing abrupt drifts, while our CDA model delivers notable improvements in prediction accuracy and F1 score on both gradual drift and abrupt drift datasets, outperforming existing methods on varying drift rates and characteristics of concept drift.

By utilizing FIMs as a common basis, we develop a unified framework that integrates CDD, CDA, and CDR tasks, thus bridging the gap between detection and adaptation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, demonstrating their applicability in various real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets. 

This work not only advances the understanding of concept drift in streaming data but also provides a general solution framework that balances performance with interpretability, thus paving the way for development of more reliable and explainable data-driven applications and systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>AI-driven recommender systems are transforming E-commerce by taking on tasks traditionally handled by human staff, such as sales associates, inventory clerks, and others. They apply machine learning methods to replace human decisions, enhance accuracy and scalability, and improve customer experiences. In this context, significant achievements have been witnessed in recent years in improving collaborative filtering-based recommender systems (CFRSs) through optimizing recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) metrics. Nonetheless, major issues remain that significantly limit the performance and generalization of these systems, such as diversity and novelty in recommendations, fairness, inclusion of long-tail items, the cold start problem, reproducibility, and evaluation overfitting. This study advocates the need for new approaches for addressing these problems comprehensively, moving beyond the traditional optimization metrics (recall and NDCG).

This work is novel in its multidisciplinary approach, integrating principles from systems engineering, software engineering, and TRIZ into the development and optimization of CFRSs. Since systems engineering takes a holistic standpoint, it allows for the reasoning and optimization of user-item interactions. Meanwhile, Software engineering provides several systematic ways and techniques to analyze and improve the functional parts of CFRSs. The TRIZ methodology facilitates the development of innovative solutions and AI tools to eliminate technical contradictions and enhance the performance of CFRSs.

To guide the optimization of CFRSs, the research also uses the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standards to evaluate the CFRSs thoroughly. These standards evaluate the reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and privacy of the CFRSs against high-quality benchmarks. The evaluation of the results based on real-world data pertaining to E-commerce datasets demonstrates that the recommendation accuracy, diversity, and coverage were improved.

All in all, the current research improves CFRS technology by providing robust, innovative, and user-centric solutions. The proposed multidisciplinary approaches serve as a template for future research and development work. The findings achieved, peer-reviewed, and published in various publications have  contributed to the discourse in academics along with practical implementation by creating high-quality CFRSs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Efficiently managing virtual resources is a critical component of server virtualization technology. The scheduler is crucial in strategically distributing Virtual Machines (VMs) and containers across diverse computing nodes, responsible for the allocation and the placement of VMs and containers on different computing nodes, and the migration of deployed ones between different nodes. In this thesis, we propose novel solutions in scheduling virtual resources, particularly in the management of VMs and containers deployed across multi-data center cloud environments. The proposed solutions leverage mathematical models, machine learning techniques, and blockchain technology to optimize scheduling decisions, enhance server consolidation, minimize energy consumption, and secure container scheduling. We introduce mathematical models for live VM migration techniques used in simulating and studying live VM migration in cloud systems environments. We present a novel distributed scheduling model that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate efficient sharing of VM status across multiple data centers. This enables prompt Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN) scheduling decisions for VMs. Additionally, we employ machine and deep learning techniques in a VM migration prediction service to identify the most suitable live migration method for each VM based on its unique characteristics. Our blockchain-based model reduces the total messages exchanged for the VM migration with percentages ranging from 0.5% to 22% and the total communication delay by 8% to 72% compared to a REST-based distributed model. The proposed blockchain-based distributed model also reduces the number of communication messages by 41.79% to 49.85% and total delay by 2% to 12% compared to a VPN-based centralized model. The Service Lvel Agreement (SLA) compliance rate of the proposed VM migration prediction service ranges from 18% to 94.9% for different machine learning algorithms and SLA policies. The proposed solution reduces the total migration time by 14% to 79% and the downtime by 64% to 99%. Furthermore, we present a novel two-stage container scheduling solution that addresses node imbalances and efficiently deploys containers as an optimization problem, integrating various objective functions and constraints to enhance server consolidation and minimize energy consumption. The confidentiality of migrated containers is ensured through encryption, and the associated costs of the proposed attributes-based encryption model are incorporated into the optimization constraints. The proposed solution's efficacy is demonstrated in its ability to efficiently deploy containers in multi-data center cloud environments and seamlessly migrate them between hosts within the same data center or across different data centers. The results show optimal consolidation with a reduction in the number of running hosts, ranging from 4% to over 18%. Additionally, the solution promotes minimal total power consumption with savings ranging from 3.5 to 16.25 megawatts, while also ensuring balanced server loads, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed container scheduling approach.</etd_ms:description>

Multi-Valued Model Checking IoT and Intelligent Systems with Trust and
Commitment Protocols
Ghalya Alwhishi, Ph.D.
Concordia University, 2024
In the era of connectivity, numerous domains utilize multi-sensor Internet of Things
(IoT) and Intelligent Systems (IS) applications, which involve complex interactions among
numerous components in open environments. This complexity challenges the verification of
these systems’ reliability and efficiency. This study pioneers the verification of IoT applications
and intelligent systems within multi-source data environments, employing multi-agent
commitment and trust protocols, particularly in uncertain and inconsistent settings.
Our research introduces efficient frameworks to model and verify these systems, incorporating
commitment and trust protocols in settings characterized by uncertainty and
inconsistency. We extend existing logics of commitment CTLcc and CTLc and the logic of
trust TCTL to multi-valued cases for reasoning about uncertainty and inconsistency. We
introduce 3v-CTLc and 3v-CTLcc, three-valued logics of commitment for reasoning about
uncertainty, and 4v-CTLc and 4v-CTLcc, four-valued logics of commitment for reasoning
about inconsistency. In the context of trust, we introduce 3v-TCTL and 4v-TCTL, multivalued
logics for reasoning about uncertainty and inconsistency over systems with trust
protocols.
To address the complexity and time needed for developing direct algorithms, coupled
with the scarcity of multi-valued model checking tools, we developed reduction algorithms.
These algorithms transform the introduced multi-valued logics of commitment and trust
into their classical case or into CTL, facilitating interaction with efficient model checkers
such as MCMAS+ and MCMASt, and NuSMV, respectively. To demonstrate the practicality and applicability of the tool in real settings, we presented
and reported experimental results over multiple IoT and IS applications in healthcare,
finance, and smart buildings. Our findings indicate that the proposed approaches and the
MV-Checker tool are highly efficient and scalable, providing accurate results under varying
conditions.</etd_ms:description>

Three Essays on Cryptocurrency Analytics and Forecasting by Using Deep Learning Models

Bahareh Amirshahi, Ph.D.

Since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2008 as the first cryptocurrency, digital assets have become favored investment options worldwide. Understanding and predicting the behavior of
cryptocurrency markets are essential for effective risk management and investment decisions.
However, the rapid fluctuations in these markets make accurate predictions a challenging task. In
this thesis, key aspects of cryptocurrency market analytics are explored from three different angles.
The recurring theme in each study involves proposing hybrid prediction models by combining a
feature extractor component with deep learning models to enhance prediction performance.
The first study focuses on predicting cryptocurrency volatility, an underexplored area
despite extensive studies in financial markets. By combining traditional econometrics methods
with deep learning models, we forecast daily volatility with improved accuracies. The findings
revealed that deep learning models not only enhance the accuracy of traditional models but also
exhibit superior forecasting when combined with such models in a hybrid approach.
In the second study, we address the challenge of predicting cryptocurrency price values.
Recognizing the impracticality of a universal model due to unique cryptocurrency characteristics,
we propose a flexible architecture tailored for each cryptocurrency. Additionally, we explore the
impact of sentiment data from Twitter posts on prediction accuracy, employing state-of-the-art pretrained
language models in an ensemble manner for more robust sentiment analysis. We show that
sentiment data improves the prediction results for more than 70% of the cryptocurrencies studied.
This indicates that social media posts, in particular tweets play a significant role in the
cryptocurrency markets behavior.
iv
The third study focuses on predicting the direction of cryptocurrency prices. We propose
an innovative approach by combining data denoising techniques with machine learning methods,
that generates high-quality data for prediction models and achieves significantly higher accuracies.
Notably, we assess the proposed approach across distinct periods: before, during, and after the
COVID-19 pandemic, filling a critical gap in research regarding predictive models during crisis
periods. We show that the predictive performance of the proposed method is not affected by high
values of volatility in challenging periods like the COVID-19 pandemic.
This research helps in developing highly accurate prediction models that can aid investors
seize profitable opportunities and avoid potential losses. By analyzing over 25 cryptocurrencies,
collectively representing 75% of the total market capitalization, this study offers a comprehensive
perspective beyond the conventional Bitcoin-centric approach.

        <etd_ms:title>Flash Boiling Atomization of Suspension for Application of Suspension Plasma Spraying</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Amrollahybiouki, Saeid</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Suspension Plasma Spraying (SPS) is a thermal spray technique used to deposit sub-micron and nano-sized particles. The liquid is evaporated by exposing the suspension to the plasma jet. Then, the particles are melted and directed in the plasma jet to impact the substrate and form a coating. SPS has lower solid feed rates and deposition efficiency compared to other thermal spray techniques. Increasing particle concentration in the suspension can enhance the feedstock deposition rate, but high viscosity and nozzle clogging are issues.
To address these issues, this study explores flash boiling atomization (FBA) as a novel injection method in SPS for high solids concentrations, up to 70 wt.%. FBA uses thermodynamic instability to break up a liquid jet. When superheated suspension is accelerated through a nozzle and its pressure drops below the saturation pressure, rapid boiling occurs. Vapor bubbles expand within the liquid jet, causing it to fragment into smaller parts. FBA has applications in various industries such as fuel injection, desalination, and pharmaceuticals. The main objective is to use FBA to inject high-solids suspensions into the plasma flow to create SPS coatings. 
Suspension injection in SPS can be axial or radial. In axial injection, fragmentation occurs inside the torch, while in radial injection, the suspension is injected from outside the torch into the plasma flow. Conventional radial injection methods include spray atomization, which creates disintegrated droplets, and mechanical injection, which produces a continuous jet. This study compared coatings made with FBA to those made with mechanical injection, assessing microstructure, deposition weight per pass, deposition efficiency, and coating thickness. Results indicated improvements across these parameters.
Water and ethanol are common suspension solvents. Water-based suspensions face challenges with atomization and evaporation resistance, impacting coating properties. FBA can improve fragmentation and prevent clogging by reducing viscosity and surface tension in the superheated state. The effect of high solids concentration and plasma power on coating microstructure, thickness per pass, deposition weight per pass, and deposition efficiency was investigated, showing that a dense coating microstructure with high solids deposition can be achieved using 70 wt.% suspension and a high power torch.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This manuscript-based thesis explores the relationships between sleep and sleep physiology during non-rapid eye-movement  (NREM) sleep stages 2 and 3, brain-health, and cognition in older adults and persons with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). It provides new insights into the associations between sleep, biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and cognition in older adults. It also provides new evidence demonstrating that spindle and slow oscillation activity during NREM sleep  constitute predictive and non-invasive biomarkers of neurodegeneration, cognition, and mental health in persons with AD.  Sleep microarchitecture can, therefore, also provide novel therapeutic targets for preserving brain-heath and slowing AD progression. These findings extend previous evidence showing that sleep may be one of the most important modifiable risk factors for functional and cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. The thesis then explores how exercise, a promising and widely accessible intervention targeting sleep physiology, can be an effective intervention for poor sleep in healthy older adults and persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment  and AD. The implications of this thesis’ findings for clinical care of persons with AD, preserving brain-health and cognition in older adults, and sleep research are discussed. Our findings can serve as a springboard for future research on sleep-based strategies to preserve brain health in older adults and delay the progression of AD symptoms, with considerable potential benefits for persons with AD, their caregivers, and communities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Advancing Short-term Bus Passenger Flow Prediction with Graph Neural Network Models</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Asiye, Baghbani</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Predicting short-term passenger flow in urban bus networks is a crucial task for optimizing transit operations, reducing congestion, and enhancing transit commuter experience. This thesis introduces several innovative deep learning models aimed at addressing the unique challenges of bus networks, including temporal dynamics, spatial variability, and the impact of real-time traffic conditions. To model the complex relationships in transit networks, we leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are particularly well-suited for capturing the non-Euclidean structure of bus networks.

In the first model, a Bus Network Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BNG-ConvLSTM) neural network is developed to forecast short-term passenger flow. This model outperforms traditional deep learning models in scalability and robustness, as validated by real-world data from the Laval bus network. Extending this, we introduce the Traffic-Aware Multistep Graph Neural Network (TMS-GNN), which integrates traffic conditions and addresses the issue of exposure bias in multistep forecasting by employing Scheduled Sampling. This model significantly improves accuracy in multistep prediction and better adapts to the realities of urban traffic patterns.

To further capture the dynamic nature of public transportation, we propose Spatial-Temporal Attention Masked Graph Encoder-Decoder (STAM-GED), which integrates real-time bus schedules to model both node and edge changes in a network. This approach provides a more accurate representation of passenger flow, reflecting the real-time operational state of bus stops.

Finally, we explore transfer learning as a solution to the challenge of data scarcity, a common issue in many cities. We develop a transfer learning framework for GNNs, which uses a novel reinforcement learning optimization-based graph partitioning method to adapt models trained on data-rich networks to cities with limited data. This framework enables the transfer of knowledge across diverse urban environments, ensuring scalability and generalizability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. 

Through comprehensive experiments on real-world data from multiple cities, including Ames-USA and Laval-Canada, our models demonstrate significant improvements in passenger flow prediction over existing methods. These contributions offer solutions for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of public transportation systems, paving the way for smarter, more sustainable urban mobility.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Low-shot learning of substrate specificity on transmembrane transport proteins</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ataei, Sima</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Transmembrane transport proteins are essential for cellular processes, selectively moving substrates across membranes. Traditional wet lab methods for detecting substrate
specificity, like binding and uptake assays, are costly and impractical for large-scale studies. Computational approaches, particularly machine learning (ML), could offer efficient
alternatives. State-of-the-art (SOTA) models to date can predict general groups of substrates carried by transporters, such as organic ions. The SOTA model TooT-SC achieves
a Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.82 predicting 11 general substrate classes.
This research presents novel computational methods for predicting transported substrates using few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot learning techniques to handle imbalanced datasets,
leveraging large language models (LLMs). These low-shot learning models enhance substrate specificity prediction.
An automatic pipeline is introduced to create machine learning (ML)-ready datasets for specific substrate groups, integrating the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases to address the lack of annotated protein
sequence data. Initial studies confirm the effectiveness of transformer-based Protein Language Models (PLMs), adapted from natural language processing (NLP), in this context.
The research focuses on three key projects: TooT-Open-ICAT (Open-world classification of Inorganic Cations and Anions Transporters) predicts inorganic ion transport using
open-world classification; TooT-Triplet-SPEC (Triplet training for substrate SPECificity prediction) predicts specific substrates through metric learning; TooTranslator shifts from
classification to regression to predict substrates of uncharacterized proteins.
The TooTranslator model advances the SOTA by improving predictions for fine-grained classes accurately predicting 93 specific substrates with an MCC of 0.92. Furthermore, the models show promise in predicting true labels for unseen classes</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Data-Driven Methods for the Safety and Security of Constrained Cyber-Physical Systems</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Attar, Mehran</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are typically defined as physical systems that are integrated with computational and communication capabilities, offering the potential to significantly enhance traditional engineering systems in terms of efficiency, reliability, and performance. However, these enhanced features also introduce potential vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, as evidenced by the various types of attacks reported against CPSs. Over the past decade, numerous control solutions have been proposed to detect these attacks and mitigate their impact on CPSs. Most of the proposed solutions are based on the assumption of precise a priori knowledge of the system’s dynamical model. However, acquiring an accurate mathematical model can be challenging, particularly when the system’s behavior is affected by unknown or uncertain factors, such as disturbances. Consequently, recent efforts have focused on developing data-driven control approaches to safeguard the safety of constrained CPSs against cyber-attacks.


In this thesis, the safety and security problems in constrained Cyber-Physical Systems using data-driven methods are addressed. In the first part of this thesis, we propose an active detection mechanism using the concept of dimensionality reduction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and optimal reconstruction for the detection of intelligent and coordinated cyber-attacks. In particular, we design a novel attack detection strategy based on a time-varying (random) encoding mechanism, which encodes the sensor measurements into a random latent space and prevents the attacker from accessing some part of the information.


In the second part of this thesis, we first introduce a data-driven method for computing backward reachable sets and Set-Theoretic Model Predictive Control (ST-MPC) tailored for constrained control systems, subject state, and control input constraints. Then, we use the developed data-driven ST-MPC along with data-driven backward and forward reachability concepts to design data-driven detection and mitigation control architectures aimed at preserving the safety and tracking performance of constrained CPSs against cyber attacks. In particular, in the first architecture, a data-driven anomaly detector based on the forward one-step evolution of the system is designed to detect the presence of attacks on the measurement channel. Moreover, on the plant’s side, a data-driven safety verification module is designed to assess whether the received control input ensures a safe evolution of the plant. If necessary, it replaces the networked controller with a local data-driven, set-theoretic model predictive controller, which aims to maintain the plant’s trajectory within a predefined safe configuration until normal operation is restored following the attack. In the second architecture, we extend the first solution in order to minimize whenever possible, the tracking performance loss of constrained CPSs in the presence of cyber attacks on the measurement channel. For this purpose, an add-on tracking supervisor module is designed which operates in an open-loop fashion in case of unreliable measurements. Moreover, on the plant side, the safety verification module is enhanced to consider multiple safety equilibrium points which allows to reduce the tracking performance loss in the presence of cyber-attacks on the actuation channel.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Impact of Prenatal Exposure to Environmental Contaminants on Cognitive and Brain Development in Childhood and Adolescence</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Azar, Naomi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Exposure to environmental contaminants is ubiquitous. Studies increasingly suggest that these chemicals pose a risk for human health, including neurodevelopment in children. Prenatal exposure to environmental contaminants warrants particular concern given the fragility of fetal development and the foundational nature of this period for the rest of the lifespan. However, little is known about potential mechanisms. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners in psychology and child development are generally unaware of such toxicological research. 
The objective of the present thesis is to examine the impact of prenatal contaminant exposure on neurodevelopment in children, explore avenues for future research on potential mechanisms, improve dissemination of toxicology studies to psychology researchers and practitioners, and advocate for a larger role of psychologists in prevention, intervention, and public policies. To do so, the thesis contains three manuscripts.
The first manuscript is a PRISMA-guided scoping review of studies on prenatal exposure to a wide range of environmental contaminants and various neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. This chapter provides an overview of neurotoxicology research from birth to age 17 inclusively and aims to make these findings more accessible to clinicians and researchers in fields relevant for child development. 
The second manuscript is an empirical study within a pan-Canadian pregnancy cohort examining the association between prenatal exposure to a flame-retardant chemical and IQ at age 3 years. This chapter provides a typical example of a developmental neurotoxicology study in terms of its method, results, and effect sizes. 
The third manuscript is an empirical study with an American community cohort composed of participants aged 6 to 20 years old. Participants underwent executive function testing and structural brain imaging at baseline and up to two follow-up sessions scheduled 15 months apart. This chapter aims to inform the design of future research into the mechanisms of neurotoxicity following contaminant exposure.
Overall, prenatal contaminant exposure is associated with small adverse effects on cognition for individuals, but has significant societal implications. Future studies should aim to better characterize potential mechanisms like cortical morphology to inform prevention and intervention efforts. Lastly, the thesis highlights the benefits of disseminating neurotoxicology findings to psychologists and child development experts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Business Analytics Research in Public Health Communication: Exploring Opportunities and Identifying Threats</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Azarpanah, Hossein</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis adopts a business analytics approach by merging data-driven and theory-driven approaches to demonstrate new opportunities for addressing public health issues such as vaccine hesitancy and health crisis management. It also examines the threat of selective sharing on social media exacerbating polarization and vaccine hesitancy.
The first essay tackles vaccine hesitancy by quantitatively analyzing eight years of data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. This study addresses vaccine safety concerns by highlighting the non-severity of reported adverse events. Cognitive biases have significant roles in connecting such concerns to vaccine hesitancy. This essay identifies and categorizes fifteen cognitive biases influencing individuals’ vaccine decision-making. These findings underscore the importance of utilizing public data sources to mitigate vaccine safety concerns and inform public health communications strategies to counteract cognitive biases influencing vaccine hesitancy. 
In two studies, the second essay delves into the role of social media in managing health crises, proposing the Social Media Health Crisis Management (SMHCM) model. By analyzing Canadian authorities’ use of Twitter (now X) during the COVID-19 pandemic for 13 months, study 1 demonstrates how authorities can facilitate shared situational awareness among citizens by disseminating declarative, procedural, and strategic knowledge. In Study 2, the SMHCM model proposes that authorities must publish posts containing declarative, procedural, and strategic knowledge to satisfy citizens’ informational needs and propagate emotional support content to cover their emotional needs during crises, increasing user engagement. The SMHCM model fills a knowledge gap by explaining how authorities can use social media to manage health crises, offering insights into effective health crisis communication strategies. 
The third essay explores confirmation bias-induced selective sharing among social media users engaged in vaccine discourse, revealing how selective sharing contributes to polarization. This essay identifies pronounced confirmation bias by analyzing over 6.6 million posts from prominent vaccine discourse participants on Twitter. It also examines the interaction dynamics between vaccine stance groups (anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and libertarian). Its findings advance our understanding of confirmation bias-induced selective sharing in the context of vaccine hesitancy and highlight the complex challenges of countering polarized opinions and fostering constructive dialogue on social media.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Effective communication among agents in open multi-agent systems (MASs) is crucial for their development. Agents operate autonomously within unpredictable environments, necessitating consideration of security, social, and communicative modalities. Trust and social commitments are pivotal in modeling secure communication mechanisms. While efforts have been made to define their semantics separately, a deeper exploration of their connection is needed.
IoT and ad hoc networks have introduced novel service models in multi-agent applications, but effective communication remains essential for coordinating various components. This cooperation enables addressing challenges exceeding individual capabilities. Ensuring component reliability is a primary concern, particularly with entities prone to malicious behavior.
Trust often varies in strength and depends on factors like past experiences and transparency. Critical systems rely on strong trust for data security and privacy, entrusting them with significant responsibilities.
This thesis proposes three verification approaches: 1) a framework, TCTLC, for handling trust over social commitments using the Model Checker for Multi-Agent Systems (MCMAS); 2) a three-valued trust model for uncertain IoT-ad hoc settings, validated through case studies in smart health monitoring and smart homes; and 3) a novel logic, TwsCTLC, capturing weak and strong trust over commitments in MASs, validated through a scalable case study.
These contributions aim to advance trust and commitment management in MASs and enhance IoT reliability in smart environments, providing practical tools for uncertain scenarios.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, our first goal is to formulate a generating function and compute its moments alongside the corresponding Hankel determinant. When the latter is nonzero, we will prove that for Painlevé 5, we can construct a Lax pair whose solution is a combination of the solution of the Riemann Hilbert Problem (RHP) and the generating function. An ingredient of that solution, called the Hamiltonian will be used to construct the Tau function which solves the ODE Painlevé V. As such, it will be easy to show that when the Hankel determinant vanishes, the RHP is not solvable, and its zeroes correspond to the poles of the rational solution of the ODE Painlevé V i.e. the Tau function.
On the other hand, an asymptotic analysis will be conducted to prove that the domain of the poles of the rational solution of the ODE Painlevé V (its domain of non analyticity) defines a well shaped region with boundaries on the complex plane as the size of the square Hankel matrix goes to infinity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Essays on Structural Labour Supply and Government
Policies</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Banihashem, Arezoo</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis uses a structural modeling approach to assess labour supply and evaluate policy programs. 

The first chapter compares labour market outcomes for high school dropouts to graduates in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia. Results show that dropouts face worse outcomes across all provinces, with Quebec having a significantly higher proportion of male dropouts. Simulations aimed at boosting employment incentives for low-skilled individuals emphaise the importance of long-term strategies that enhance skill acquisition and reduce financial barriers. Current welfare eligibility criteria offer limited incentives to transition from welfare to work at modest wages.

The second chapter focuses on modeling individual heterogeneity, particularly unobserved characteristics, using random coefficients. It uses Monte Carlo simulations across six scenarios with varying shapes and variances for the distribution of unobserved characteristics. Findings reveal that methods accounting for heterogeneity perform well when variances are small, but become sensitive to distribution shapes as variances increase, indicating the need for more flexible models in high-variance contexts.

The final chapter examines the labour supply of single mothers, with a focus on childcare utilisation and social assistance participation. Contrary to traditional views, the study finds that childcare costs are no longer a significant barrier to employment, with access to childcare being a more critical issue. Policies targeting direct employment incentives may be more effective in increasing labour force participation. The chapter also highlights the role of unobserved preferences in shaping work decisions, suggesting that current programs may be limited by not fully addressing these behavioural factors.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Mapping Resonance: Tracing the Senses Communicating in the Spaces Between Deaf and Hearing People</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bath, Paula</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research seeks to trace how communicating feels, smells, tastes, sounds and looks in the spaces between deaf people and hearing people. By shifting the focus from “barriers” to spaces, from limitations to relationalities, and way from auralism and phonocentrism towards a polysensory understanding of communication, this thesis breaks with the conventional constructions of the hearing/not-hearing nexus, and opens up many new prospects for interpersonal and intersensory interaction between hearing people and deaf people. This creative and community-engaged ethnographic project was an inter-sensorial exploration that included eleven participants across four languages: English, French, American Sign Language (ASL), and Langue des signes québécoise (LSQ) as well as multiple language modalities, written, spoken, and signed. The first phase explored a social-institutional context and involved conducting two semi-structured interviews with two deaf university students who pursued human rights complaints against the same university after being denied access to sign language interpretation—even as their respective cases occurred twenty years apart. The second phase explored a social-creative context and involved conducting two focus groups, each participant exploring their own sense of communicating across deaf and hearing spaces. In each phase, participants described their narratives and experiences through visual, tactile, and auditory mediums, including narratives, maps, collages, video, sign language poetry, objects, and illustrations. Next, situational and relational mapping methods were employed to trace the experiences sensorily and multi-modally. Findings suggest that in contrast to popular transactional communication models, there are no barriers or gaps to communication; communicating is a persistent, inter-sensory experience that exists in the relationships between people and their environment, and occurs across time and space. In this light, new conversations are needed regarding our accountability to these relationships and how these inter-sensory spaces of communication impact our individual and collective well-being.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Three Essays on Social Security Disability Insurance Participation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bayarjargal, Munkh-Ireedui</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Over the last three decades, the U.S. labor force has increased by less than thirty percent, while the number of Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries has almost tripled, despite improvements in overall labor force health. This thesis examines individual-level DI participation using micro-public surveys and a blend of empirical and theoretical dynamic models, presented in three chapters.

The first chapter explores the relationship between DI participation, skill level, and labor market outcomes. By extending the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides framework to include heterogeneous skills and endogenous DI participation, the model examines the effects of aggregate productivity, health-related eligibility criteria, and DI application success rates. Key findings include: (1) economic downturns prompt higher-skilled individuals to seek disability benefits, narrowing the wage gap; (2) relaxed health-related eligibility criteria increase DI participation among less skilled workers, widening the wage gap; and (3) higher DI application success rates boost participation with minor effects on skill composition.

The second chapter investigates how health, productivity, and labor market outcomes influence DI participation. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the study finds that better health conditions are associated with higher wage growth and lower DI participation probability. An equilibrium search model incorporating health-driven productivity, endogenous DI participation, and job separation reveals that health shocks significantly impact DI participation and labor market outcomes. Policy evaluations show that shorter initial determination periods raise unemployment, while shorter appeal processes reduce it. The persistence and volatility of individual health conditions are critical for understanding DI participation levels.

The third chapter analyzes the impact of non-health factors, such as DI and Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit replacement rates and unemployment duration, on DI participation using an empirical logistic model. This chapter provides the first microdata-based evidence on these factors. Results indicate that higher DI benefit replacement rates and longer unemployment duration strongly increase DI participation, especially among less educated and older workers. 

In summary, this thesis offers a comprehensive analysis of DI participation, highlighting the roles of economic conditions, health dynamics, and policy factors in shaping labor market and DI outcomes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Making of the Management Machine: Subjectivity, Desire, and Living Labour</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Baysal, Dilara</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores how managerial practices and workers operate within capitalist work relations, focusing on how they influence and are influenced by the production of subjectivities across various historical and social contexts. Central to this study is the concept of living labour—the dynamic and creative capacity of workers to generate value through their labour. In capitalist economies, living labour is managed through strategies that aim to maximize productivity and efficiency, often involving control, coordination, and standardization. Consequently, management’s role is to organize and regulate living labour in alignment with the interests of capital, converting workers' potential into measurable outputs. This process reflects a core principle of capitalism: that labour must be continually transformed and subsumed by capital to generate profit.
Drawing on Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of desire as a productive force that generates connections and drives creation between people, objects, and systems, I argue that managerial practices play a critical role in shaping the ongoing formation of new configurations and possibilities. By theorizing the production of subjectivity as an open process continually actualized in the social realm, this project uncovers how social relations—whether in early industrial factories or contemporary tech offices—become terrains of struggle. Through interviews with managerial workers in tech startups, this research examines the affective and immaterial dimensions of managerial labour, showing how it functions as a vital component in securing the conditions necessary for capital accumulation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Integrated Optimal Design and Operation of Compressed Air Energy Storage for Decentralized Applications</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>Decentralized hybrid energy system, Adiabatic-compressed air energy storage, Optimal design, Optimal operation, Cost-effectiveness, Resilience, Dynamic modelling</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis aims to investigate the integration of compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology into decentralized energy systems, addressing associated technological and integration challenges within the dynamic energy system environment. A multi-layer simulation-optimization framework is developed to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility of integrating decentralized CAES into local hybrid energy systems (HES) through optimal sizing and operation. In the first layer, an improved energy management operation strategy (I-EMOS) is designed to enhance the integration of adiabatic-CAES (A-CAES) systems into decentralized applications. In doing so, the interaction and limitations of A-CAES subsystems, including power conversion units, air storage tank, and thermal energy storage, are considered to evaluate the long-term performance and dynamic behavior of A-CAES systems, especially when connected to intermittent renewable energy sources and end-user load demand. Subsequently, the second layer develops a holistic sizing-planning framework, including a generic A-CAES model and various alternative power dispatch strategies (PDS), based on the application potentials of A-CAES. This module aims to enhance A-CAES contribution while minimizing the levelized cost of energy and achieving the optimal configuration for the corresponding applications. Eventually, the final layer focuses on improving the resilience of the energy system, incorporating A-CAES technology, within scenarios involving limited energy sources and hybrid energy storage solutions. Therefore, an operational unit-commitment optimization model is developed, considering the A-CAES system's response and charging-discharging transition times. This model is integrated into the sizing-planning module to co-optimize the economic performance and system resilience through two-stage optimization, involving long-term planning and short-term scheduling. The methodology is applied to Concordia University buildings in Montreal, Canada. Validation against data from an existing A-CAES pilot plant shows a 42.5% improvement using I-EMOS compared to traditional EMOS. 
Optimal configurations under various PDSs demonstrate energy cost savings between $0.015 and $0.021 per kWh, with significant improvements in electrical load management (52%) and carbon emission reduction (65%) for the system in which A-CAES is planned for both solar energy integration and seasonal load shifting.  Furthermore, under the worst-case scenario (zero selling back), the HES achieves a PV self-consumption rate of around 92% and a payback time of 15.5 years. In scenarios of limited grid dependency, a substantial annual resiliency improvement of approximately 41.1% is achieved by integrating the energy storage system. Additionally, despite the superior cost performance of the PV/A-CAES system, the PV-based HES featuring hybrid A-CAES, and battery storage achieves a 47.3% electrical load management ratio and a 96% self-consumption rate, improving by about 6% over HES with only A-CAES system. Furthermore, findings indicate that under optimal operational conditions, even with the highest PV power availability during grid interruptions, the HES could meet 94% of load demand using individual A-CAES, increasing to 100% by integrating fast-response batteries. In conclusion, the proposed framework offers a reliable approach for integrating and customizing decentralized A-CAES systems, considering specific service requirements and constraints. It identifies critical times of loss of power probability, enhances understanding of local energy system design, and facilitates better integration with renewable energy sources and storage systems. The findings provide valuable insights for decision-makers, helping select suitable systems and scenarios based on key performance indicators. The framework also is adaptable to various scale scenarios, accommodating both local and regional generation considerations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Deep Learning Ultrasound Image Analysis: From Classification to Segmentation with Limited Data</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Behboodi, Bahareh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used imaging modalities in diagnostic and sur- gical settings due to its affordability, safety, and non-invasive nature. However, US images are prone to speckle noise, leading to low resolution and making clinical interpretation chal- lenging. Recently, researchers have applied state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) algorithms from the field of computer vision to the clinical domain. These algorithms require extensive annotated data to achieve meaningful results. In clinical US imaging, however, there are limited available datasets because annotating US images is time-consuming and requires ex- pert radiologists. Additionally, many hospitals restrict data sharing due to patient privacy policies, further limiting the development of DL algorithms for clinical US images. To ad- dress these limitations, this thesis focuses on developing innovative DL algorithms capable of performing with small datasets. Specifically, in Chapter 2, we use simulated US images as an alternative dataset to pre-train a breast tumor segmentation model. We further explore how network design complexity affects segmentation performance with limited data. In Chapter 3, we leverage 2D planes from 3D uterus US scans to develop a segmentation model using data from only 10 cervical cancer patients. In Chapter 4, we create a compact segmentation network with just 0.82 million parameters, applying knowledge distillation to transfer knowl- edge from a well-trained teacher model with 96 million parameters. This approach is ideal for portable US devices, where computational and memory-efficient models are required at the bedside. In Chapter 5, we introduce a novel approach to breast lesion classification by incorporating background as an additional class, improving the detection of invasive ductal carcinomas. In Chapter 6, we develop a framework for detecting quadriceps muscle thickness in US images, an important biomarker for frailty assessment. This framework also provides activation maps, highlighting the model’s focus on either the muscle body or bone surface. The availability of well-annotated datasets for DL model development has been a significant challenge in this thesis. To address this gap, in our final chapter, Chapter 7, we present a publicly available, expert-annotated dataset of intra-operative US images for brain tumor resection—the first of its kind, verified by two expert surgeons. Finally, in Chapter 8, we summarize our findings with concluding remarks and potential future works.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis advances the understanding of creativity by exploring its connection with sensory perception, particularly through divergent perception, a concept that extends beyond traditional divergent thinking approaches. It posits that creative ideas emerge not only from how we generate thoughts but fundamentally from how we perceive our environment, emphasizing the role of sensory ambiguity in the creative process. By integrating cognitive neuroscience with music theory, this work examines the relationship between sensory ambiguity and creative perception. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), it investigates the neural underpinnings of divergent perception and its interaction with stimulus properties and individual creativity levels through a series of theoretical work and experimental studies (Chapters 1 to 3). These studies reveal that the brain's processing of ambiguous stimuli and its spontaneous activity are influenced by the individual's level of creativity, particularly when exposed to scale-free visual stimuli. Transitioning from visual to auditory perception, the thesis introduces a musically-inspired model of brain dynamics, emphasizing the creative potential of biosignals and their inherent harmonic complexity for musical exploration (Chapters 4 and 5). This includes the development of a Python toolbox for harmonic analysis of biosignals, designed to facilitate artistic and scientific exploration of the latent harmonies in living systems. Through this interdisciplinary approach, the thesis underscores the significance of divergent perception in creativity and offers new tools and models for investigating the complex interplay between sensory ambiguity, perception, and creative output.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Probing microstructure and optical properties of organic
semiconductor thin films</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The immense success of conjugated organic molecules (COMs) in the multi billiondollar OLED industry has equally raised the interest in conjugated polymers (CPs) for
organic electronics. This is largely due to their flexibility and scalable, solution-based
processing using cost-efficient methods. In most applications, the utility of such organic
semiconductors (OSCs) in electronics relies heavily on tuning their electronic properties
via doping. Unlike COMs, which can easily form highly ordered films via vacuum deposition, CPs are thermally fragile, thus, typically requiring solution processing. This
often results in films with less-defined microstructures influenced by various experimental conditions. Further, CPs are susceptible to structural and chemical defects that reduce
their conjugation length. This thesis employs the unconventional method of high-vacuum
electrospray deposition (HV-ESD) to create poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) films under
minimal solvent influence elsewise only applicable for COMs. Conventional solutionprocessed P3HT is typically semi-crystalline, comprising crystalline and amorphous regions as shown by X-ray diffraction. In contrast, it is found in this work that HV-ESD
yields highly amorphous films. This technique allows therefore studying CP films without the complexity of mixed crystalline and amorphous regions, which is important in
analyzing properties like the doping of P3HT, where these regions respond differently
to doping and information gathered thereon is generally convoluted. Further, this thesis focuses on COMs exploring the optical and structural properties of blends created
by the rod-like molecules α-sexithiophene (6T) and para-sexiphenyl (6P), which are prototypical OSCs. Vacuum co-deposited films yield a mixed crystal structure, confirmed
by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction, and unique optical properties. The blends show
green emission alongside the characteristic red and blue emissions of pure 6T and 6P explained by J- and H-type aggregation. Additionally, this work includes studies addressing
the molecular doping of oligomers to examine transitions between distinct doping phenomenologies based on the conjugation length, and the yet to be fully understood doping
of P3HT by Lewis acids as alternative dopants. These studies are nearing publication.
Overall, by commissioning HV-ESD as a tool to deliberately establish amorphous OSC
films, and by assessing OSC blends and molecularly doped OSCs in thin films, this thesis
contributes a broad view on the interplay between structural and optoelectronic properties of this important material class.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Investigating the regulation of Arabidopsis stomatal development by ABA</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bharti, Kritika</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Stomata are microscopic valves in the plant epidermis that efficiently exchange gas while minimizing water loss. Their patterning and differentiation are influenced by various signals, including the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA is crucial for stomatal closure during stress conditions, particularly drought. While ABA's role in stomatal movement is well-studied, our understanding of ABA’s role in controlling stomatal development and the mechanisms underlying its interaction with the stomatal development pathway are limited.
In this study, the characterization of ABA-deficient and ABA-signaling mutants indicated that ABA regulation of stomatal development is mediated by upstream signaling components, including PYR/PYL/RCAR (ABA receptors), ABI1/ABI2 (ABA phosphatases), and SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6 (SnRK2 kinases), but is likely independent of the transcription factors in the core ABA signaling pathway. We analyzed the epidermal phenotype of ABA signaling mutants. The abi1-2 abi2-2 mutants, lacking two negative ABA signaling regulators, showed remarkably fewer stomatal and non-stomatal cells on the plant epidermis. Among nine ABA PP2Cs, we further identified ABI1 and ABI2 phosphatases as key regulators of stomatal development. To investigate epidermal defect generated in ABA signaling mutants, I examined the epidermal phenotype of wild type, abi1-2 abi2-2, and snrk2.2 snrk2.3 mutants using the TMMpro: GUS, a stomatal lineage cell-specific marker. The abi1-2 abi2-2 mutant showed fewer epidermal cells entering stomatal lineages, while the snrk2.2 snrk2.3 mutant exhibited an increased number. This finding indicates ABA restricts stomatal cell lineages. Using high-order ABA and stomatal mutants, we next investigated the molecular link between ABA signaling and stomatal developmental pathways. Our genetic interaction studies showed that ABIs act upstream of the stomatal receptors TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) and ERECTA family members (ER, ERL1, ERL2), the MAP kinases MPK3 and MPK6, and the transcription factor MUTE in the stomatal development pathway. Based on our genetic interaction data, we analyzed the physical interactions between ABI1/2 and ERECTA family receptors and TMM. Our data demonstrated that ABI1, but not ABI2, interacts with stomatal receptors, ER, ERL1, and ERL2.
Our data reveal novel interactions between ABA signaling and stomatal development pathways, expanding our understanding of ABA's role beyond stomatal movement regulation. These findings suggest potential strategies plants may employ to optimize growth and adapt to environmental stresses like drought. This research establishes a framework for future investigations into the intricate links between ABA and stomatal developmental pathways.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Automated Planning and Scheduling Method for Modular Construction Manufacturing</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bhatia, Angat Pal Singh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Modular construction is a promising alternative to conventional construction; offering improved productivity, high-quality end products, and reduced labour requirements. To realize these benefits, sequencing module components during prefabrication process in a manner that ensures efficient allocation and utilization of labor resources at workstations is essential. However, one of the significant challenges in modular construction manufacturing (MCM) is that it follows a make-to-order process, resulting in customized module components. This customization leads to variations in the design specifications of module components, causing different processing times at each workstation. These imbalances in production lines result in increasing the waiting time for module components between the workstations, ultimately extending the makespan. This poses a challenge for production line managers, requiring frequent adjustments to plans and schedules related to the sequencing of module components at workstations using conventional methods.
To address these challenges, this thesis introduces a framework composed of three modules: (i) a simulation-based statistical method for planning in modular construction; (ii) a deep neural network (DNN)-based method for predicting production process times; and (iii) a hybrid optimization technique for scheduling in modular construction. In the first module, a simulation based statistical method is developed to plan the sequencing of module fabrication and the allocation of workers at workstations. The method encompasses data collection process to obtain historical/near real-time data and identification of significant impact factors affecting process times at workstations along the production line. In the second module, a newly developed method for predicting processing time at each workstation is introduced utilizing Deep Neural Network (DNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for predicting production process time spent at each workstation in a manufacturing plant. The third module focuses on planning and scheduling method that ensures optimal sequencing of module components at workstations using Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Simulated Annealing (HGASA).
Two case studies were analyzed to demonstrate the use of the developed methods and test their performance. The first case is of a light gauge steel (LGS) wall panel production line operated by a modular fabricator in Edmonton, Canada, and the second is of a wood-based semi-automated wall panel production line also in Edmonton, Canada. These cases involve the production of 200 wall panels in the first case and 39703 wall panels in the second at various workstations along the production line. The simulation-based statistical method developed in the first module yielded 89.39% accuracy in prediction of process time and indicate a 44.42 hr duration to produce 309 wall panels with regards to first case. The results of the second case showing process time predictive method developed in the second module for most workstations had a mean absolute error (MAE) of under 2.50 minutes, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) ranging between 22 % - 28%, respectively. The developed scheduling method of the third module provided an optimal sequence of wall panels for prefabrication, minimizing makespan. As a result, the hybrid optimization reduces makespan to 105.63 hr from those generated by GA (138.08 hr) and SA (108.06 hr).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Functional Studies of Protein Assemblies Involved in Bacterial Siderophore Biosynthesis</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bin, Xue</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Iron is an indispensable micronutrient for most microorganisms. A high-affinity iron chelator called enterobactin is synthesized by Escherichia coli to scavenge scarce ferric iron from its extracellular environment. The biosynthesis of enterobactin is carried out by sequential orchestration of six enzymes, EntC, EntB, EntA, EntE, EntF, and EntD. Previous studies on enterobactin biosynthesis and other siderophores, like pyoverdine and bacillibactin, indicate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are extensively engaged in these processes, leading to the thesis research goals of ongoing mapping and functional characterization of this PPI. We hypothesize these interactions, albeit weak, may occur among EntC, EntB, and EntA which are responsible for synthesizing 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (2,3-DHB), a precursor for enterobactin. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a higher-order enzymatic assembly (i.e., a metabolon) forms in the E. coli cytoplasm to facilitate efficient catalysis and regulation of iron homeostasis at the protein level. Here the first evidence of an interaction between EntC and EntB both in vivo and in vitro is reported, thereby completing the map of pairwise PPIs among all the enterobactin biosynthetic enzymes. Further characterization reveals an electropositive channeling surface between the EntC active site and EntB isochorismate active site, suggesting an electrostatic channeling mechanism of enhancing metabolic flux by preventing labile intermediates from diffusing into the bulk solution. Given EntB’s central role in enterobactin biosynthesis, this enzyme is likely a target for regulation. A novel role for 2,3-DHB as a feedback inhibitor of EntB isochorismatase activity was identified, as well as its effect on the down-regulation to the EntCB isochorismate channeling. Finally, a chimeric protein was constructed, composed of dimeric and enzymatically active EntB and EntA fused components, paving the way to investigate the potential existence of higher-order Ent complexes and their recognition of cognate partners.</etd_ms:description>

Emotions and Sociopolitical Context Matter</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bleuer, Jessica</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research presents key findings from a Concordia University (Montreal, Quebec) arts-based action research study, that used Theatre of the Oppressed techniques to support educators in addressing racial and ethnic microaggressions (or racialized microaggressions) in higher education classrooms. Theatre of the Oppressed’s inherent capacity to attune to the body, the relational and the affective influenced the creation of a racial and ethnic microaggression strategy roadmap called the Pause-Reflect-Respond model that encourages students and educators to work through and learn from the emotional and psychophysiological activation caused by racialized microaggressions. The Pause-Reflect-Respond model employs a harm reduction approach that aims to address racialized microaggressions and return the classroom to a space for optimal learning. The model seeks to protect the targets of racialized microaggressions from further harm, educate microaggression enactors and to foster collective responsibility for racial and ethnic microaggression by contextualizing their systemic nature. Pause-Reflect-Respond’s capacity to serve students and educators from diverse social locations will be critiqued and recommendations to increase the model’s applicability, relevance, and inclusiveness across racial and ethnic microaggression contexts will be shared.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>REFINING OPTIMIZATION METHODS FOR TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS: A CASE STUDY IN ROBOTIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Boabang, Francis</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Gesture Recognition, Robotic Surgery, Machine Learning, Optimization,</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Machine learning is a technology that builds predictive models from data, allowing generalization to unseen cases. At the core of every learning problem lies an optimization challenge, and solving these problems reliably is crucial to resolving the obstacles surrounding machine learning. Primarily, conventional optimization algorithms employed for training machine learning frequently are often ill-suited for various applications. Concerted efforts are needed to refine and optimize various components of machine learning training. This thesis explores fundamental optimization algorithms across various machine learning applications. By enhancing optimization schemes, including optimizers and model compression techniques, the resilience and effectiveness of machine learning applications can be improved.

The first segment of the thesis introduces an innovative low-rank matrix factorization scheme aimed at enhancing the scalability of machine learning. Gaussian Process Regression is used as the machine learning
model to scale with low rank matrix factorization in this section of the thesis due to its lightweight nature, which enables the incremental updating of model parameters online prior to prediction. A nonconvex
formulation of a low-rank matrix factorization (SRLSMF) with convex formulation of a low-rank matrix factorization initialization (ℓ1-SRLSMF), is advocated to scale Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Thus, by
employing convex nonconvex low rank matrix factorization to scale a given the Gaussian Process Regression model, the model can avoid local minima and converge to a solution with smaller recovery residuals.
Also, the running time of convex nonconvex low rank matrix factorization is expected to be smaller than that of applying nonconvex low rank matrix factorization alone under the same stopping criterion. To the best of our knowledge, the machine learning method proposed in this thesis is the first to exploit nonconvex formulation of a low-rank matrix factorization (SRLSMF) with convex formulation of a low-rank matrix factorization initialization (ℓ1-SRLSMF) to scale machine learning in machine learning domain. Recognizing the cost-prohibitive nature of standard eigen decomposition for online Gaussian Process Regression covariance update, we implement incremental eigen decomposition within the ℓ1-SRLSMF and SRLSMF Gaussian Process Regression methodologies. Finally, an illustration of the potential applications in suturing, knot-tying and needle passing task using kinematic dataset is provided.

In the latter part of the thesis, a novel adaptive stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) method, which leverages the non-uniform p-norm concept to train machine learning is presented. The proposed ASGD assigns distinct categories of coordinate values with varying base learning rates, thereby enabling the training of machine learning models. Additionally, theoretical guarantees for the efficacy of the proposed ASGD method in convex and nonconvex settings is discussed. The ability of the proposed ASGD approach to detect suturing gestures within the remote surgical gesture recognition task is discussed.

Finally, potential avenues for future research are outlined.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Innovative Approaches for Real-Time Toxicity Detection in Social Media Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bodaghi, Arezo</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Toxic comments on social media discourage user engagement and have serious consequences for mental health and social well-being. Such negativity heightens feelings of anxiety, depression, and social isolation among users, ultimately diminishing their experience on these platforms. For businesses, these toxic interactions are detrimental as they lead to reduced user engagement, subsequently affecting advertising revenue and market share.
Creating a safe and inclusive online environment is essential for business success and social responsibility. This requires real-time detection of toxic behavior through automated methods. However, many existing toxicity detectors focus mainly on accuracy, often neglecting important factors including throughput, computational costs, and the impact of false positives and negatives on user engagement. Additionally, these methods are evaluated in controlled experimental settings (offline tests), which do not reflect the complexities of large-scale social media environments. This limitation hinders their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.
This thesis addresses these limitations by introducing a Profit-driven Simulation (PDS) framework for evaluating the real-time performance of deep learning classifiers in complex social media settings. The PDS framework integrates performance, computational efficiency, and user engagement, revealing that optimal classifier selection depends on the toxicity level of the environment. High-throughput classifiers are most effective in low- and high-toxicity scenarios, while classifiers offering moderate accuracy and throughput excel in medium-toxicity contexts.
Additionally, the thesis tackles the challenge of imbalanced datasets by introducing a novel method for augmenting toxic text data. By applying Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), this method fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate diverse, semantically consistent toxic data. This approach enhances classifier robustness, particularly in detecting minority class instances.
The thesis also proposes a Proximal Policy Optimization-based Cascaded Inference System (PPO-CIS), which dynamically assigns classifiers based on performance and computational costs. This system improves efficiency by using high-throughput classifiers for initial filtering and more accurate classifiers for final decisions, reducing the workload on human moderators.
Extensive evaluations on datasets such as Kaggle-Jigsaw and ToxiGen demonstrate significant improvements in processing time, detection accuracy, and overall user satisfaction, contributing to the development of scalable, cost-effective toxicity detection systems for social media platforms.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Comparison of Students’ Models of Knowledge to be Learned in an Introductory Linear Algebra Course with Results from Prior Research on Such Models in College Calculus Courses</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Brandes, Hadas</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Research done from an institutional perspective has found students to develop non-mathematical practices in college calculus courses that emphasize routinization of knowledge. The knowledge students are expected to learn, as indicated by tasks determining their grade in the course, enables students to routinize techniques and use non-mathematical considerations, such as didactic and social norms from their course, to justify their techniques. Such research has mostly been done in the calculus context. To calibrate the study of the effects of institutionalized routinization of knowledge, I investigated these in the context of a course in a different domain of mathematics and regulated by institutional mechanisms similar to those regulating college calculus courses. To this end, I adapted, to an introductory college linear algebra course at a large urban North American university, the framework and methodology from a body of research that qualifies students’ activity by attending to institutional mechanisms that regulate it. The framework appends to the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD) (Chevallard, 1985, 1999) notions from the Institutional Analysis and Development framework (IAD) (Ostrom, 2005). The ATD provides tools through which to model activities that occur in institutions and the IAD elaborates institutional mechanisms that regulate activity that occurs in institutions. I analyzed curricular documents to develop task-based interviews (TBI) that could draw out the nature of the knowledge students mobilize. I conducted interviews with ten students shortly after they had completed the course. The qualitative approach I used included an analysis of curricular documents to model knowledge to be learned in the course that relates to each TBI task, as well as an analysis to model the knowledge students mobilized in response to each TBI task. I found students mobilized non-mathematical practices: what they activated was conditioned by and delimited to knowledge normally expected of students in the course, and their mobilization contrasted in various ways with mathematics intrinsic to the tasks they were offered. I also propose an operationalization of the institutional notion of positioning previously proposed and examined as a mechanism regulating students’ activity in didactic institutions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Collaboration in the Studio Art Classroom: Making Meaning Together</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Collaboration in the studio art classroom is an amalgamation of students, materials, ideas, and skills. This assemblage of human and non-human factors can create unique pedagogical experiences for students. It can also create a support network that helps students in their early careers as artists and art educators. The idea of the artist as a lone genius persists from modernism even though many galleries, biennials, and art fairs have embraced collaboration as a way of art making. The lone artist, working away in the studio on the next masterwork is dispelled by other artist periods and movements, where we see other ways of working such as the apprentice and master model, or more artist collectives and groups where ideas are interchanged, such as Dada, or the Bauhaus. 
In this study we look at the experiences of students, professional artists, and post- secondary instructors who utilize collaboration. Using these experiences, the study outlines an orientation towards collaboration that can help instructors plan collaborative assignments in their class. This study uses both phenomenology and Actor Network Theory to describe the experiences of participants. Phenomenology allows for deep description of the experiences of participants, however, it does not fully account for the agency of non-human actants and privileges the subject. Therefore, Actor Network Theory has been utilized to account for these non-human factors while still privileging the experience of the participant. This was done through an interview process where participants recounted their experiences privileging both their relationship with their collaborators as well as with materials and technologies that they used to collaborate.
These interviews overlapped in many ways and three major categories helped organize the experiences of the students, artists, and instructors. They were ‘flexibility’ and ‘openness’, ‘structure and process, and ‘community and relationships’. Flexibility and openness described the participants relationships to each other, as well as the materials that they used. Structure and process helped participants navigate the exchange of ideas that is necessary for collaboration without becoming fixed on the end result. Finally, community and relationships were the overarching frame and ethos that allowed for collaboration.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Molecular Doping of Organic Semiconductors: Role of Steric
Hindrance</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Charoughchi, Somaiyeh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The p-doping of organic semiconductors, that is, conjugated organic molecules
(COMs) and polymers (COPs), is generally done using strong molecular acceptors as
dopants. In principle, high doping efficiency can be achieved with dopants of high
electron affinity (EA) to promote integer electron transfer between COP/COM and the
p-dopant. Common dopants of high EA (&gt; 5 eV) are, however, often unstable, show
low solubility in common solvents with most COPs/COMs, and tend to diffuse through
the organic semiconductor owing to low molecular weight. Furthermore, their planarity
can promote the formation of ground-state charge transfer complexes (CPXs) with the
COPs/COMs, which is detrimental to doping efficiency due to fractional instead of integer
charge transfer. To address this issue, this thesis focuses on a new strategy towards
more efficient molecular p-dopants: The optimization of EA to promote integer electron
transfer is therein augmented by a novel strategy to inhibit CPX formation, which relies
on directed dopant design exploiting steric hindrance. First, to identify promising
alternative dopants with high EA, we systematically compared the interplay between
molecular EA and steric shielding of the core resulting from the peripheral substitution
of analogues molecules with cyclohexadiene and cyclopropane cores. To this end, we performed
a simple analysis based on Hammett parameters followed by density functional
theory (DFT) calculations on a library of modified doping agents. Second, based on the
outcome of the DFT pre-characterization we focused on cyclopropane core-based dopants
and synthesized and characterized 2,’,2”-(cyclopropane-1,2,3-triylidene)tris(2-(perfluoro
phenyl)-acetonitrile) (PFP3CN3-CP) as one of the most promising species. PFP3CN3-CP
has pendant functional groups that sterically shield its central core while still maintaining
a comparably high EA. By using various spectroscopy and electrical characterization
we demonstrate for the prototypical COP, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), that, indeed,
CPX formation can be inhibited by exploiting steric hindrance brought by PFP3CN3-CP.
It outperforms a planar dopant with similar EA, showing tenfold higher conductivity and
superior stability in aging experiments. Overall, this thesis introduces a novel strategy
for improving p-doping efficiency in organic semiconductors by incorporating steric
hindrance to prevent CPX formation. It advances the development of more efficient
p-dopants, contributing valuable knowledge to the field.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Comparing second language English speakers’ engagement with and perception of collaborative versus competitive board games from a self-determination theory perspective</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Chen, Tzu-Hua</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>International students pursuing further studies in English-speaking countries often encounter many challenges. However, few solutions have been proposed to connect them with other international students and increase their psychological needs satisfaction and engagement during L2 interaction. Drawing on Deci and Ryan’s (1985) self-determination theory and adapting Philp and Duchesne’s (2016) model of task engagement, this study compared the effects of a collaborative (Mysterium) and a competitive (Camel up) commercial board game on 54 international students’ perceived basic psychological needs satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness on their engagement during board game interactions with other international students in an English-medium university in Canada. Adopting a counterbalanced design, transcripts of players’ interactions were analyzed in terms of three dimensions of engagement: cognitive, social, and emotional. Post-game questionnaires on psychological needs satisfaction and on overall engagement with board game interactions, as well as interaction data were analyzed through Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the two types of board games. The relationships between psychological needs satisfaction and aspects of task engagement and were analyzed through Spearman’s rho correlation analyses. Two groups of international students’ responses to open-ended post-game questionnaires about needs satisfaction and factors affecting their engagement, focus group interviews, and transcripts of interactions were analyzed through the lens of self-determination theory. 
The findings showed that participants playing the competitive board game experienced significantly higher level of autonomy than playing the collaborative board game, whereas participants playing the collaborative board game experienced significantly higher level of relatedness than playing the competitive board game. In terms of engagement with the board games, they had significantly higher level of cognitive engagement while playing the collaborative board game than the competitive board game, which was manifested in both their actual language use and questionnaire responses. However, although they reported significantly higher level of social engagement while playing the collaborative board game than playing the competitive board game, they produced significantly fewer responsiveness instances while playing the collaborative board game than playing the competitive board game. With respect to the link between BPN and aspects of engagement with the board game, it was found that international students who felt satisfied with their psychological needs of autonomy were emotionally engaged with the two types board games, whereas those who felt satisfied with their psychological needs of relatedness were socially engaged with both types of board games. Additionally, playing the collaborative board game enhanced their feeling of relatedness, which additionally made them emotionally engaged in English interaction with international students from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Moreover, their feelings of competence were associated with responding to peer players’ utterances and contribution (coded measure of social engagement). The study found that peer support and collaboration played a key role in satisfying the players’ psychological need of relatedness, regardless of board game types. Game design also played a crucial role in fulfilling or thwarting their psychological need of autonomy and competence for both competitive and collaborative board games. As for factors affecting L2 English international students’ engagement, the most prominent influencing factor for engagement with the two board games is game design, followed by game type. Collaboration with and support from peer players also played an important role in their engagement with the board games, especially the collaborative board game. Based on research results, implications for study abroad education were discussed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Microplastic Entrainment in Ice Formations and Their Electrochemical Removal from Water</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Chen, Zhikun</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Sea ice can act as a temporary sink for microplastics (MPs), which also function as secondary sources and transport mediums for MPs. While field investigations have confirmed the widespread presence of MPs in ice, knowledge about their environmental fate in cold regions remains limited. This study investigates the entrainment of MPs during ice formation processes and how freezing alters their behavior in water. Additionally, an electrochemical removal technology was developed to separate MPs from water, addressing the issue at its source.

The study first explored the effects of various MP properties and environmental conditions on the entrainment and enrichment of MPs in ice under different turbulence scenarios. Results revealed that high turbulence in freshwater significantly increased the entrainment of hydrophobic MPs in ice, due to the combined influence of frazil ice and air bubbles. The hydrophobic nature of MPs led them to concentrate at the water/air or water/ice interface. However, in saline water, high turbulence inhibited the entrainment of all MP types, as loose ice structures allowed for the exchange of MPs between ice and water, resulting in rapid expulsion. In calm saline conditions, MP enrichment factors were higher compared to calm freshwater.

Next, the study examined the interactions between aquatic organic matter and MPs, focusing on how these interactions influence MP behavior during ice formation. A 28-day experiment evaluated the effects of dissolved organic matter on MP properties under UV and dark conditions. Findings revealed that aquatic organic matter adhered to MPs, with varying impacts on different MP types. Surface damage caused by physical abrasion and UV radiation improved the entrapment of MPs in ice, highlighting the critical role of MP properties in their environmental behavior.

As temperatures fluctuate, MPs stored in ice can be released, and freezing conditions can alter their properties, affecting their fate in the environment. Freezing in freshwater led to MP aggregation through physical compression, increasing particle size upon release. This aggregation enhanced buoyancy, accelerating the settling or rising velocity of MPs in water. In contrast, the presence of salt mitigated freezing effects due to the formation of a brine network within the ice structure, reducing pressure on entrapped MPs. 

To address the issue of MP release into the environment via wastewater, this study developed an electrosorption (ES) technology using graphite felt electrodes to remove MPs from water. Preliminary experiments investigated the effects of flow rate, applied voltage, and electrolyte concentration on MP removal efficiency. Under optimal conditions, 96.9% of MPs were removed after 150 minutes. By analyzing the factors influencing MP removal efficiency and the underlying mechanisms using DLVO theory, this study provides a foundation for future advancements in ES technology for MP removal, with potential for real-world applications in complex environments.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Habitat loss and fragmentation, due to anthropogenic land transformation, is the leading cause of species declines and biodiversity loss worldwide. Habitat loss and fragmentation transform landscapes into a heterogeneous array of habitat fragments of smaller total habitat area, isolated from each other by a human-dominated matrix. This results in long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function, and an overall reduction in species abundance and movement ability between fragments. Globally, 56% of all terrestrial mammals have transboundary geographic ranges. In contrast, most conservation initiatives do not cross political boundaries. The Adirondack-to-Laurentians (A2L) transboundary wildlife linkage connects wilderness areas in 
the northeastern United States with southeastern Canada. Although the region contains many habitats of high ecological integrity and biodiversity, ceaseless anthropogenic land transformation within the A2L may be putting transboundary connectivity at risk. Changes in 
landscape structure, due to anthropogenic land transformation, that occurred within the A2L between 1992 and 2018 were quantified, and priority areas for conservation and restoration were identified. The results suggest that to achieve long-term functionality of the A2L, collaborative and coordinated measures will be necessary to preserve the integrity of the Québec portion, restore extensive habitat in eastern Ontario, and reestablish or maintain connectivity throughout the linkage. The results can be used to inform conservation policy and land-use planning throughout the region. Left unaddressed, continued anthropogenic land transformation is likely to have additional detrimental effects on the ability of the A2L to function as a transboundary wildlife linkage.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The effects of diet and probiotic administration on lipid dysregulation and gut microbiota dysbiosis during atherosclerosis development</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease caused by lipids, cells, and debris accumulating in arterial walls. Despite their popularity for effective weight loss, low-carbohydrate/high-protein diets (LCHP) are more atherogenic than Western diets and are associated with adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes. However, the mechanisms of this atherogenicity are not currently known. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to determine if circulating lipid profiles, inflammatory lipid mediators, and/or gut dysbiosis contributed to the higher atherogenicity of the LCHP diet in ApoE KO mice during the early development of plaques. Secondly, it was hypothesized that supplementation of two probiotics: Lactobacillus helveticus Lafti 10® and Bifidobacterium bifidum Rosell 71® could reduce diet-induced atherogenicity during the early stages of the disease due to their antilipemic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 
In order to accurately observe the changes in lipid and inflammatory pathways over a 6-week longitudinal study in mice, an optimization of analytical methods was necessary to ensure appropriate lipid stability during analytical handling and compatibility with low blood volumes (30-50 μL). First, the impacts of short exposure to room temperatures and the effect of the addition of a lipase inhibitor, Orlistat, during lipidomics sample preparation were investigated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Human plasma samples were prepared using isopropanol protein precipitation at room temperature, 4°C, and -80°C with, or without, Orlistat. Subtle changes in the lipidome were found even for short (&lt;2 hr) exposure to room temperature, so maintaining a strictly controlled temperature of 4°C throughout the sample preparation process is recommended to reduce residual enzymatic activity. Room temperature exposure during sample preparation impacted the levels of 19% of the lipids but the addition of Orlistat reduced this impact to less than 2.4% of measured lipids and improved method precision across all temperatures. To enable oxylipin determination from 15 μL of plasma, solid-phase extraction – liquid chromatography – high-resolution mass spectrometry method was further optimized. This optimization maintained good coverage, acceptable recovery (71 to 100%) and excellent precision (RSD &lt; 11%), thus making the method suitable for longitudinal monitoring of oxylipin status in mice using small blood volumes collected by tail bleeding. 
Next, the effects of diet and probiotic supplementation on lipid and gut dysbiosis were investigated. ApoE knockout mice were fed LCHP, W, or standard chow diet for 6 weeks, with or without anti-inflammatory probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus helveticus Lafti 10® and Bifidobacterium bifidum Rosell 71®) at low- or high-dose. Targeted and untargeted analyses using liquid chromatography – high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to study dyslipidemia and inflammatory pathways, whereas gut microbiome analysis was performed using 16S rRNA sequencing. When comparing the effects of the diet, the time course study showed that the microbiota in the fecal pellets of the mice given W and LCHP diets were globally similar. However, gut dysbiosis occurred faster for the mice fed the LCHP diet compared to the W diet. In addition, mice fed the LCHP diet had a higher abundance of deleterious families such as Sutterellaceae Parasutterella and beneficial families such as Muribaculaceae Muribaculum, Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides or Erysipelotrichaceae Dubosiella than the W diet. Furthermore, the relative abundance of beneficial species such as Bifidobacteriaceae and Eurobacterium Coprostanoligenes and deleterious families such as Erysipelotrichaceae Turicibacter, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcaceae Streptococcus, Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospiraceae were decreased compared to the W diet groups. Plasma levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a pro-atherogenic gut-derived metabolite, were unchanged between the LCHP and W groups, indicating that the increased atherogenicity of the LCHP diet is not promoted by this pathway. In terms of lipid dysregulation associated with early stages of atherosclerosis, LCHP and W diets showed similar oxylipin profiles but distinct from the C diet. When comparing the LCHP and W diets, only eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which prevents atherosclerotic plaque formation and stabilizes it, was lower in the plasma of the mice fed the LCHP diet compared to the W diet. Circulating oxylipin plasma profiles from mice fed LCHP and W diets showed a similar increase of 19,20-dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosapentaenoic acid (19,20-DiHDPA) and a decrease of arachidonic acid (AA) with time. In addition, 8S,15S-dihydroxy-5Z,9E,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-DiHETE) and 15-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E,17Z-eicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE) increased with the LCHP diet over time. In contrast, only 5,6-dihydroxy-8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,6-DiHETE) increased with time with the W diet. Overall, the inflammatory pathways were similar in both LCHP and W diets and are unlikely the cause of the higher atherogenicity of the LCHP diet. In addition, the 9-HODE/13-HODE ratio increased with time for the LCHP and W diets indicating a pro-inflammatory profile for both diets compared to the C diet. Plasma levels of sphingolipids, lysophospholipids, phospholipids, alkyl-phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters levels were lower in the LCHP diet compared to the W diet but higher when compared to the C diet. In contrast, glycerolipids were higher in the LCHP diet compared to the W diet. 
 The time-course study revealed that probiotics had minimal effect on the oxylipin profiles and the 9-HODE/13-HODE ratio was not affected by the probiotic supplementation demonstrating limited anti-inflammatory properties. However, the administered probiotics showed antilipemic properties by reducing highly unsaturated lipids from phosphatidylethanolamine and triglyceride classes. In addition, alkyl phospholipids were elevated with the probiotic administration in combination with the LCHP diet. Furthermore, probiotic supplementation also positively influenced the gut microbiota composition by increasing beneficial families such as Tannerellaceae and Clostridia Vadin BB60 genera, and decreasing harmful bacteria including Streptococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Atopobiaceae. Overall, the effects of probiotic supplementation showed a strong dependence on the diet type indicating strong diet-microbiota interaction. In conclusion, this thesis establishes for the first time systematic changes in circulating lipid levels and gut dysbiosis that are contributing to the atherogenicity of the LCHP diet and examines how probiotic supplementation impacts these adverse changes. These findings are critically important to ensure highly popular weight loss interventions such as LCHP diets do not cause unintended adverse cardiovascular consequences.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Toppling failure in jointed rock masses presents a complex geological challenge. Conventional numerical methods often struggle to capture its intricacies, particularly when dealing with jointed rock masses. Experimental studies are both time-consuming and financially demanding. To address these challenges, this thesis employs the Discrete Element Method (DEM), a powerful numerical tool capable of accurately simulating toppling failure processes in jointed rock masses, with a specific focus on block-flexural toppling in natural rock slopes. The DEM not only accurately replicates toppling failure but also provides an efficient alternative to expensive experiments.
The research convincingly demonstrates DEM's precision in predicting failure surfaces and its ability to accommodate large deformations and discontinuities make it a powerful tool. The DEM emerges as a potent and cost-effective tool for simulating toppling failure in jointed rock formations, accommodating large deformations, block interactions, and the consideration of discontinuities during failure. The developed DEM code was utilized to simulate and investigate the toppling failure after being validated with experimental test results. The study also explores key parameters like joint friction angles, spacing, and basal joint sets, investigating their influence on failure mechanics and the overall failure surface, a fundamental assumption in the theoretical method for analyzing toppling failure based on the limit equilibrium method. Overall, this study highlights the assumption that a single failure surface used in the limit equilibrium method is not necessarily valid for block-flexural toppling failures.
Utilizing a developed computational code, this research extends its relevance to real-world scenarios, effectively simulating complex rock slope conditions. It emphasizes the importance of particle size calibration in DEM simulations, highlighting the need to strike a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The research reveals that the maximum particle size relative to the minimum sub-domain size, represented by joint spacing or block width, is critical for precise simulations.
The findings indicate that DEM excels in capturing the complexities of toppling failures, especially when challenged with large deformations and block separation. In practical scenarios, DEM outperforms traditional theoretical methods by providing a more accurate assessment of safety factors and offering insights into the intricate micro-level interactions within rock slopes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Mapping Cadastral Records as Evidence of Colonial Land Theft: A Kanehsata'kehró:non-backed Investigation into the Archives of Quebec’s Sulpician Priests</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Saint Laurent valley, Quebec, became increasingly surveyed as France, England, and later Canada, claimed land and removed the Indigenous people who inhabited it. In Kanehsatà:ke (also known as Oka), the rights and interests of the Kanehsata'kehró:non were never included in the mapping process and they were continually denied rights and recognition. This research aims to reclaim land surveying by repurposing cadasters and land patents, originally used by religious and governmental institutions, for the Kanehsata'kehró:non to talk about land that was historically taken from them. While cadastral mapping has been critiqued as a tool of colonial surveillance and control, I flip the traditional power dynamic by mapping where settlers live and how they acquired land. This shift demonstrates that cadastral maps and archives can function not only as instruments of control but also as tools for liberation.

To achieve this, I outline my mapping process in three parts. First, I review how maps and archives have been reshaped through counter-practices. I interview an art historian, a Citizen Potawatomi cartographer, a Kiowa journalist, and a historian recycling colonial land records in critical Indigenous mapping projects. These conversations provide a broad perspective on the intersection of maps and archives, highlighting unique insights, ethical considerations, and challenges in studying them together. Second, with the guidance of a Kanehsata'kehró:non Land Defender, I designed and led an investigation into the archives of the Sulpician priests. I developed a methodology to repurpose these “counter-archives” into a geospatial database for use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Finally, I explored future uses of my mapping project by tracking how various stakeholders plan to use the map to advance their own intentions and priorities.

This approach not only demonstrates how colonial maps and archives provide different perspectives on historical events but also how to leverage these differences to amplify the voices of those who have been marginalized or silenced. By turning my attention towards the increasing Indigenous led research in colonial archives, I trace the emergence of new kinds of mapping projects and explore innovative uses of cadastral data to support political change. Recognizing colonial archives as a mappable dataset for Indigenous benefit broadens the scope of settler colonial studies in Quebec, a field that often plays second fiddle compared to other provinces. Ultimately, while mapping archives can serve as a basis for contemporary debates on land rights, reparations, and Indigenous sovereignty, the true essence of the work lies in cultivating and maintaining the relationships that bring these maps to life.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Formalization of Partial Differential Equations using HOL Theorem Proving</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Deniz, Elif</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central for the mathematical modeling of many physical and engineering problems such as heat transfer, the flow of fluids and the radiation of electromagnetic waves. Solving these equations is essential for gaining precise insights into the behavior of such systems. Traditionally, the analysis of PDEs has been performed using paper-and-pencil based proofs or computer-based
numerical methods. However, these analysis techniques compromise the soundness and accuracy of their results, especially in safety-critical systems, due to the risk of human errors and inherent incompleteness of numerical algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose to use formal methods, in particular higher-order logic (HOL) theorem proving, for analyzing PDEs. The main motivation of this choice is the highly expressive and sound nature of HOL, which can be used to effectively model most systems that can be expressed in a closed mathematical form.
   In this thesis, we introduce a comprehensive framework for the formal analysis of mathematical models of physical systems described by PDEs using the interactive proof assistant HOL Light. In particular, we have developed formal libraries for the heat, Laplace, telegrapher’s and wave equations. Each library includes the formalization of these PDEs, encompassing their formal definitions and the formal verification of some classical properties as well as their analytical solutions. These libraries constitute distinct contributions, each providing substantial value for various applications. To demonstrate the practical utility and effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct the formal analysis of several physical systems such as thermal protection, transmission lines, and potential flows.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Holographic direct sound printing</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Derayatifar, Mahdi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The sound-based 3D printing method, introduced as Direct Sound Printing (DSP) by our research group, represents a novel advancement in additive manufacturing. DSP, driven by sonochemical polymerization, has traditionally been limited to a single acoustic focal region, resulting in a voxel-by-voxel printing approach. To address this limitation, this dissertation leverages advanced acoustics, including acoustic holography, to enhance robustness and reduce printing time.
First, design considerations for Phased Array Transducers (PAT) in DSP were investigated, focusing on element size, spacing, and configuration to optimize real-time acoustic field reconfiguration. Building on this, the primary focus of this PhD work is the development of Holographic Direct Sound Printing (HDSP). HDSP uses acoustic holography to store cross-sectional images, patterning acoustic waves to induce regional cavitation bubbles and enable on-demand polymerization. Compared to DSP, HDSP improves printing speed by an order of magnitude and produces layerless printed structures. In HDSP, the holographic field remains stationary while the printing platform moves in three dimensions using a robotic arm.
Extensive experiments, including sono-chemiluminescence and high-speed imaging, validated HDSP's capabilities, demonstrating applications such as remote ex-vivo in-body printing and free-form printing with robotic arm control. Multi-object and multi-material printing were also demonstrated, with comprehensive characterization of the process, including hologram design, polymerization tracking, porosity tuning, and robotic trajectory computation.
Additionally, acoustic holography was optimized using the Adaptive Iterative Angular Spectrum Approach (IASA) and a novel deep learning method called Deep Holographic Reconstruction Network (DHR-Net). The optimization improved the uniformity and quality of acoustic fields, enhancing the printing process. The impact of 3D printing parameters on hologram performance was examined, focusing on energy transfer and material loss reduction.
This dissertation establishes HDSP as a new paradigm in sound-based 3D printing, integrating advanced acoustic holography to overcome traditional DSP limitations and expand applications in additive manufacturing.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Mechanochemically enabled methods for sustainable and scalable synthesis of small molecules and functional materials</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Effaty, Farshid</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Mechanochemistry, which induces chemical reactions via mechanical agitation, offers a promising alternative to traditional solution-based synthesis by reducing solvent use and chemical waste. This thesis investigates mechanochemistry-specific methods for the sustainable and scalable synthesis of small molecules and functional materials.
Chapter 2 employs resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) to perform mechanoredox diazonium couplings, with BaTiO3 as the piezoelectric catalyst. RAM proceeds without formal grinding or impact media and is readily scalable compared to ball-milling. X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy indicate that reusability of BaTiO3 as a mechanoredox catalyst under ball-milling or RAM is limited by boration.
Chapter 3 introduces the concept of direct mechanoredox catalysis by utilizing a piezoelectric organic polymer, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). PVDF, transformed into a piezoelectric phase, is used to create catalytically active reaction vessels, coatings, and inserts, enabling mechanoredox reactions under ball-mill and RAM conditions. Using aryldiazonium salt borylation as a testbed, five methods for PVDF-based catalysis are explored: (i) PVDF as a powder additive, (ii) a milling jar, (iii) a coating on conventional jars, and a strip insert under (iv) ball-milling or (v) RAM conditions.
Chapter 4 demonstrates a rapid, room-temperature mechanochemical synthesis of 2  and 3 dimensional boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs), enabled by using trimethylboroxine as a dehydrating reagent to overcome the hydrolytic sensitivity of boroxine based COFs. This approach achieves high-porosity, crystalline COF, including the first 3-D COF synthesized mechanochemically. Compared to solvothermal methods, this method reduces solvent consumption 20-fold and reaction time 100-fold, delivering quantitative yields with minimal workup. Straightforward scale-up by RAM enables synthesis of multi-gram amounts of the target COFs.
Chapter 5 investigates RAM-assisted topochemical [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions of trans 1,2 bis(4 pyridyl)ethylene to synthesize cyclobutane moieties in the solid state. Appending ultraviolet light-emitting diodes to the RAM instrument enables templated cocrystallization and photocycloaddition to proceed in situ in one pot. This study specifically reports the supramolecular catalysis potential of four templates, including citric acid. Notably, we show that the reaction works when using lemon juice as catalyst, thus elevating the green chemistry aspects of the methodology.
Collectively, this thesis advances mechanochemistry methods and demonstrates potential for sustainable and scalable synthesis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Structural components are susceptible to different types of loading, such as monotonic and cyclic loadings, etc. Fatigue loading is cyclic in nature and falls into two general categories: low-cyclic fatigue and high-cyclic fatigue. Glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are suitable replacements for steel reinforcement rebars due to their corrosion-resistant characteristics. This characteristic warrants an extended service life for GFRP RC structures. The research investigates the fatigue performance of ribbed GFRP bars in concrete, which is crucial due to the growing use of GFRP as a substitute for traditional steel reinforcements. An experimental program was carefully planned to evaluate the fatigue life of ribbed GFRP bars within concrete beams, including factors such as concrete strength and the degrees of fatigue stress applied. An innovative displacement-controlled testing technique was devised to address the limitations of conventional force-controlled fatigue testing methods. The results demonstrate that ribbed GFRP bars may withstand up to 2 million cycles of fatigue stress, exceeding current code standards and questioning previous empirical data. This research also includes the fatigue characteristics of ribbed GFRP bars during tension-tension fatigue through a detailed review and innovative experiments. The experimental program included the fatigue, the fatigue life and the behaviour of ribbed GFRP bars, classifying them according to the testing protocol. Low-frequency fatigue testing is between 0.03 and 0.04 Hz, and fatigue tests are under higher frequency fatigue testing at 4 Hz. This research identified an optimal gripping mechanism for conducting fatigue tests on GFRP bars and evaluated the feasibility of using conventional universal testing machines for fatigue life assessment, commonly found in many structural laboratories.  In addition, the impact of influential factors such as stress ratio is examined through a testing program. Finally, the study expands to present a simplified model based on the Sendeckyj model, but it utilizes a normal distribution to forecast the fatigue life of FRP-RC elements under repeated loading situations. This novel method is used to analyze fatigue data for GFRP, CFRP, and BFRP materials, allowing for the creation of S-N-P curves to be simplified with accurate estimations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In this dissertation, we explore the technical nuances of blockchain technology, its diverse applications, and the unforeseen consequences that have emerged. Cryptojacking, initially seen as a potential disruptor to the convoluted online advertising industry, ultimately succumbed to its own success due to regulatory gaps and technical intricacies. The inherent transparency and permissionless nature of blockchain allow every participant to potentially exploit privileged information --adversarial environment--, leading to front-running attacks and extracting value from users. Additionally, oracles, vital for providing real-world data to decentralized applications, might change the trust assumptions based on their implementations, which necessitate a deeper understanding of their operational mechanisms. With the rise of cryptoassets as a significant financial sector, auditors face challenges in accurately evaluating and reporting these assets due to their novelty. This dissertation aims to bridge the gap between the ambitious promises of blockchain technology and its real-world implications, highlighting the technical nuances that often lead to misunderstandings. We argue that by narrowing the divide between traditional regulatory view and blockchain's technological advancements, both auditors and companies working with cryptoassets stand to gain from the enhanced transparency and the potential for real-time information reporting (e.g. financial statements) offered by this technology.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Three Essays on the Economics of Information</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>F. Pichette, Samuel</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis consists of three essays on the Economics of Information, focusing on strategic information acquisition and on the design of disclosure rules.

In Chapter 2, a decision-maker relies on the information reported by a panel of experts to take an action. These experts may observe relevant information and have preferences over the decision-maker’s actions. Each expert possesses three qualities: (i) the probability that he acquires information, (ii) the probability that this information is inaccurate in favor of his agenda, and (iii) the level of this error. Conscious of these qualities, the decision-maker forms her optimal panel to make the most informed decision. We show that it is generally better for the decision-maker to have experts with identical agendas if these experts cannot misreport their information, even if it is inaccurate.

In Chapter 3, we consider a variation of the model presented in Chapter 2 in which experts’ information is always accurate. Moreover, each expert can now incur a cost to increase his probability of obtaining information. The objective of the decision-maker is to form a panel to make the most informed decision, while experts have their own preferences. We show that there exist levels of cost of effort such that experts in a homogeneous panel will choose to exert no effort, while experts in a diverse panel will exert some. In addition, we find that for a sufficiently high return on effort, a diverse panel is optimal.

In Chapter 4, one agent – the sender – benefits from two other agents – the receivers – taking some actions. Each receiver possesses private information referred to as his type, and can disclose it truthfully or not. The sender has a private type which she does not observe at first but can condition a communication device, observed by every agent, on its different realizations and on the reported types. In turn, this provides the receivers with action recommendations. We show that depending on the alignment of the preferences, the optimal rule ranges from fully revealing the sender’s type to no revelation at all, and that most of the times only partial information is revealed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the application of 4D printing of composites (4DPC) in the manufacturing of complex-shaped components, focusing on its potential in various engineering domains. The study begins with an in-depth examination of the fundamental principles underlying 4DPC, encompassing topics such as material properties, lay-up sequences, and the impact of thermal expansion coefficients and modulus of elasticity ratios on the bifurcation temperature of laminates. Experimental investigations are conducted to analyze the behavior of composite laminates under different conditions, revealing insights into how parameters like thickness ratio, lay-up sequence, and edge effects influence the final configuration of the laminates.
A significant portion of the research is dedicated to studying the effect of edges and overlaps on the curvature of composite laminates, uncovering critical insights into how these factors impact the shape and performance of the manufactured components. Furthermore, the thesis presents a detailed analysis of the application of 4DPC in the manufacturing of blades for vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs), highlighting the method’s potential to produce intricate geometries with tailored mechanical properties.
Throughout the thesis, theoretical and finite element analyses are complemented by experimental validations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of 4DPC in composite manufacturing. The findings contribute to advancing the knowledge base in the field of additive manufacturing, offering valuable insights for engineers and researchers exploring innovative approaches to fabricating complex-shaped composite structures. The potential application of 4DPC in manufacturing VAWT blades underscores its relevance in renewable energy technologies, highlighting its role in shaping the future of sustainable engineering practices.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Essays on Non-GAAP Reporting</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fan, Hui</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Non-GAAP reporting; Quantity of non-GAAP metrics; Voluntary disclosure; Determinants; Analysts earnings forecasts</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation consists of two essays, which explore the quantity of non-GAAP metrics, and one proposal, which investigates non-GAAP forward-looking metrics.
The first essay examines the determinants of the quantity of non-GAAP metrics disclosed in quarterly earnings releases using a hand-collected sample of non-GAAP disclosures from 2016 to 2020. Results show that managers are likely to disclose a larger quantity of non-GAAP metrics when their firms have more complex accounting reports and more extensive intangible assets. These findings suggest that when firms’ information environment is relatively poor, investors likely have a greater demand for additional information, and managers provide more non-GAAP metrics to respond. In a subsample where firms have missed analysts’ expectations, I find that when firms just miss the expectations, they are more likely to use a greater quantity of non-GAAP metrics, suggesting that managers’ self-serving incentives play a role in distracting investors’ attention by information overload.
The second essay explores the impact of the quantity of non-GAAP metrics on analysts’ forecast accuracy and dispersion. Results show that analysts’ forecast accuracy is increasing, and their dispersion is decreasing for firms with a larger quantity of non-GAAP metrics (or categories). Among the twelve non-GAAP categories, non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP tax rate are associated with more accurate and less dispersed earnings forecasts; however, return on invested capital increases the disagreement among analysts and leads to less accurate earnings forecasts. Furthermore, I find that a greater quantity of non-GAAP metrics/categories is particularly beneficial to analysts who have less general experience and cover more industries in their portfolios.
Last, I propose a study to explore non-GAAP forward-looking measures and primarily examine managers’ decisions to issue different quantities of non-GAAP forward-looking measures. In contrast to extant prior research on non-GAAP historical measures, studies on non-GAAP forward-looking measures are scant. This proposal intends to fill the void. In addition, to the extent that current regulations give managers broad discretion to issue forecasts that exclude certain recurring expenses and to rely on the “unreasonable efforts” exception to omit GAAP reconciliations, the findings of this study will also be of interest to standard setters.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Design of a Systematic Comprehensive Integrative Indicator-based Sustainability Assessment Framework for Organizations</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>In response to the urgent need for organizations to comprehensively assess their sustainability performance, this research introduces a novel approach through the development of the Systematic Comprehensive Integrative Indicator-based Sustainability Assessment Framework (SCII-SAF). This framework addresses the limitations of existing sustainability assessment frameworks (SAFs) by providing a systematic and integrative method for selecting, evaluating, and understanding sustainability indicators (SIs). A thorough literature review of SAFs across diverse industries reveals a critical gap: the lack of a universal method for identifying the most relevant indicators and assessing their interdependencies without heavy reliance on subjective expert judgment. Current multi-criteria decision-making models, such as AHP, DEMATEL, TOPSIS and VIKOR, offer valuable insights but suffer from their dependence on expert opinion, leading to subjective assignments of importance. To address this, this research proposes an innovative data-driven approach that integrates correlation analysis and network analysis for evaluating static relationships and interdependencies, and system dynamics simulation to capture dynamic changes and the performance impact of SIs over time. This hybrid methodology, combining graph theory with machine learning, represents a unique approach not previously applied in academic literature. By minimizing reliance on expert judgment, the SCII-SAF enhances objectivity and analytical rigor. The SCII-SAF model provides a groundbreaking, data-driven framework that aligns SIs with long-term sustainability objectives, offering decision-makers valuable insights. It facilitates informed decision-making by quantifying trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability, tailored to specific industry needs. By integrating Network Analysis for structural understanding and System Dynamics Simulation for temporal and dynamic insights, this research not only addresses significant limitations in existing SAFs but also represents a transformative contribution to sustainability assessment practices.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Tableau-based Algebraic Calculus for Description Logic SHOIQ</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Farid, Humaira</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The growing demand for efficient knowledge representation and reasoning in the era of interconnected systems and extensive data collection motivates this thesis. Addressing the limitations of existing Description Logic (DL) reasoners, we focus on the challenges posed by qualified cardinality restrictions (QCRs), nominals, and inverse roles. These constructs, though crucial for expressive ontologies, often hinder computational efficiency in traditional reasoning approaches. Consequently, real-world ontologies either exclude them or employ very small numerical values. This motivates our exploration of a novel reasoning approach, employing algebraic methods, aiming to enhance DL reasoning with a focus on large numerical restrictions.

In this thesis, a novel algebraic tableau calculus for SHOIQ is presented for deciding ontology consistency. This hybrid approach integrates standard tableau-based reasoning with algebraic reasoning to handle a large number of nominals, QCRs, and their interaction with inverse roles. The algorithm extends the previously presented algebraic tableau algorithm for SHOI. Numerical restrictions imposed by nominals and qualified number restrictions are encoded into a set of linear inequalities. The knowledge about other axioms, such as universal restrictions, role hierarchy, subsumption and disjointness, is also embedded in order to get a more informed mapping of QCR satisfiability to feasibility. Column generation and branch-and-price algorithms are used to solve these inequalities. The feasibility test for the linear inequalities can be computed in polynomial time. Rigorous proofs ensure soundness, completeness, and termination of the reasoning procedure.

In practice, the proposed reasoning approach, implemented in the Cicada prototype, demonstrates its effectiveness against existing state-of-the-art reasoners. Empirical evaluations using synthetic and ORE 2014 datasets reveal Cicada's robust performance against increasing numerical values, showcasing its viability for handling expressive ontologies. Despite its more focused optimization techniques, Cicada outperforms other reasoners in certain scenarios, providing a promising avenue for practical applications requiring efficient DL reasoning.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Design and Verification of Optomechanical Actuation for Tunable Filters</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fasihanifard, Mohammadreza</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The exponential growth of network traffic, driven by applications such as IoT, 4K TVs, and cloud computing, demands an immediate need for enhancing network capacity. Optical fiber networks, fundamental to this enhancement, must handle massive data volumes efficiently. In order to address this, maximizing the existing optical network's capacity through dynamic networks and wavelength reconfigurability in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems has emerged as a practical solution. Central to this approach are tunable optical filters (TOFs) and tunable lasers, which enable the selection and transmission of multiple data channels over a single fiber. In this work, a TOF with a 30 nm bandwidth (1535-1565 nm) across 5 channels, each with 30 nm tunability and 7.5 nm channel spacing, was selected to optimize performance within the C-band, known for its low attenuation and wide usage in optical communications. Silicon photonics, with its promise of smaller, faster, and more efficient photonic circuits, has advanced significantly, offering practical applications in integrated optical signal processors, external cavity lasers, and WDM systems. However, the mechanical tuning of photonic devices, crucial for dynamic network reconfigurability, requires robust actuators capable of delivering high force, broad travel range, and minimal footprint. This thesis investigates the design and optimization of MEMS actuators, specifically electrostatic comb drives with triangular finger configurations, to meet these stringent requirements. This research delves into various electrostatic actuator designs with a focus on optimizing force intensity, travel range, and spatial efficiency on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) platforms. It aims to enhance the performance of actuators for stiff, monolithic slab waveguides in silicon photonics, which requires high-force actuators due to their inherent mechanical rigidity. The study also explores the potential of angled electrode designs to improve microsystem actuator performance, providing a balanced approach to force intensity and travel range within a compact footprint. Additionally, the research addresses fabrication discrepancies and develops models to compensate for these variations, ensuring the reliability and consistency of manufactured devices. This thesis also covers the design and simulation of photonic components for a multichannel mechanically tunable optical filter and the external cavity of a diode laser. It involves the design of a concave diffraction grating (CDG) in Littrow mode, specifically tailored for compatibility with mechanical tuning. The study includes analytical modeling and validation through finite difference time domain (FDTD) and finite element method  (FEM) with multiphysics simulations. The research further investigates the multichannel performance in various configurations and explores mechanical designs to reduce stiffness. Finally, the modeling and simulation of the designed multichannel optical filter are validated through experimental work, including selecting appropriate fabrication technology, performing scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements, and testing the device using an edge-coupling setup. The fabrication of the optical filter configuration on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) platforms has been demonstrated, and the process has been considered in a way to facilitate easy post-processing for creating tunable optical filters. Overall, this thesis contributes to advancing silicon photonics by demonstrating that creating tunable filters on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) platforms is possible by providing innovative solutions for the mechanical tuning of photonic devices. These advancements, enhance the functionality, flexibility, and efficiency of optical communication systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>State of Salmonid Streams Around the World: A Multi-Scale Investigation of Habitat Quality, Restoration, and Abundance</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Many salmonid species are listed as threatened or endangered, despite over a hundred years of conservation efforts. Additionally, little is known about the spatial extent and abundance of salmonid populations around the world. This research combines ecological and hydrogeomorphological approaches to investigate salmonid abundance in streams. It uses a meta-analysis, field observations and a systematic review to assess restoration options for salmonid populations, determine if a morphological index is aligned with physical habitat and fish-based indices, and explore the range of salmonid abundance in streams around the world. Data from 100 stream restoration projects show that in-stream structures, a common restoration technique for salmonids, increase salmonid abundance. However, most projects are implemented at small spatial scales of a few hundred metres, and monitored for less than 5 years, which may be insufficient time for population changes to be apparent. Hence, it is unclear whether these projects provide a long-term solution. The Morphological Quality Index (MQI) considers fluvial processes at larger scales as well as channel forms, human impacts, and historical changes, but few studies have assessed its relevance for ecosystem health. A significant correlation was found between the MQI and habitat quality (using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index, QHEI), in 26 salmonid streams, but establishing a strong correlation with fish metrics remains challenging. To describe the metrics of salmonid abundance at a broader spatial scale, a database was created using published material of over 1000 rivers with estimated salmonid biomass, covering 27 countries. This allowed detailed analyses of differences in biomass by species, region, period, and sampling techniques. Mean global biomass is 5.2 g/m2, and while most streams are under 10 g/m2, there is a large range (0-70.3 g/m2). Salmonid production recorded for 194 rivers averaged 6.3 g/m2/yr, and biomass and production were highly correlated (R = 0.82) with a mean production to biomass (P/B) ratio of 1.08. Expanding the list of variables in the database can help develop models to predict salmonid biomass, and determine conditions in high biomass streams. This knowledge will be useful for conservation and management authorities to design successful conservation programmes at a watershed scale.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Understanding the dynamics of financial markets specially during financial crises and being able to forecast these markets are crucial for policymakers and investors.  This dissertation aims to explore the dynamics of Crude oil, Gold, Silver, and Cryptocurrency markets from various perspectives.
The first topic of the dissertation involves comparing the dynamics of cryptocurrencies, crude oil, and gold markets before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic comprises two research studies: First, we investigated the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the return-volume and return-volatility relationships of crude oil, gold, and ten-most traded cryptocurrency markets. The findings of the first study enable policymakers and investors to better react to the dynamics of digital currencies, and commodity markets during financial crises. Then, using statistical and econometrics methods, we examined the interactions between these markets before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated whether gold or crude oil can play a safe-haven role for cryptocurrency markets during the pandemic crisis. This study assists hedge fund managers or individual investors to adapt their risk exposure to crude oil, gold, and cryptocurrency markets during the financial crises. 
For the second topic, several deep learning, machine learning, and hybrid models are adapted to improve the forecasting of crude oil, gold, and silver markets. For this purpose, I implemented sixteen different deep learning and machine learning models on historical price data and compared the prediction performance of these models across four different input sequence lengths to find the optimal settings in forecasting each market. The findings of this study assist investors, policymakers, and governmental agencies to effectively anticipate market trends and make informed timely decisions regarding crude oil, gold, and silver markets.
Lastly, I propose three graph-based neural networks models to predict the direction of price movements in crude oil, gold, and silver markets using a comprehensive set of features such as historical price data, global macroeconomic factors, supply and demand-related factors, other financial markets, and technical indicators. The proposed graph-based models consider the relationship among various factors that can affect the direction of price movements in crude oil and precious metal markets and can be considered as a feature extraction module for predicting the future trend of crude oil, gold, and silver markets.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Queer Archiviology: HIV and AIDS Media, Queer Genealogies and Expansive Possibilities in the New York State Council on the Arts Electronic Media and Film Memory Archive</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fraser, Dorian J.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The New York State Council on the Arts has been a fundamental fixture of public arts funding in the United States since its inception in 1960. Despite a contentious homophobic and anti-Leftist suspicion of public arts funding, the Council provided financial support to emerging queer artists and enabled access to breakthrough media tools for independent media production after the cultural paradigm shift of the Stonewall rebellion. This support, specifically through the NYSCA’s Electronic Media and Film program, would prove crucial to queer storytelling and AIDS activist media during the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s. An archival collection of the NYSCA program is now held in institutions across New York State as the NYSCA Electronic Media and Film Memory Archive. Although the purpose of the Memory Archive is to preserve the records and identity of the NYSCA’s EMF program in a study collection, the Council’s ardent support of openly queer media art and AIDS activism is obscured by organizational issues such as multiple institutional repositories and suffers from a paucity of institutional history. Reading the materials of the Memory Archive for the presence of queer media from gay liberation through the AIDS crisis requires confronting the absence of meaningful institutional address of queerness and HIV and AIDS, despite support for revolutionary media activism and storytelling across the agency. To combat this archival malformation, I propose a ‘queer archiviology’: a method that allows for the necessary movement between practical and conceptual applications to create generative queer genealogical potential in existing institutional archives. This hybridity is achieved through the prioritization of both grassroots archival methods and professional practices in the embodied realm of the queer researcher-archivist, enabling lateral archival extensions that push against discrete divisions between archival collections to instead pursue queer kinship. These familial resemblances between objects, texts and traces of the queer world-making and AIDS activist art supported by the NYSCA are established across and in between institutions. This method is invoked as an expansive genealogical mapping project in the contemporary moment as a continuing intervention in the existing collections of the Memory Archive.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Mediations: Affect, Power, and Subjectivation on Kaggle</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Frizzera, Luciano</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Over the past decade, the widespread investment in digital infrastructure and the extensive digitization of individual behaviour have provided the basis for the rapid development of machine-learning techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI datafy our body and our identity, producing live databases full of calculated linkages between humans and nonhumans. It creates a new cartography of biopower that sometimes produces technologies, but always produces subjects. This research examines the political economy of subjectivation in the “making of” machine-learning algorithms and AI by closely examining the relations of power, affect, and subjectivation on Kaggle, the world’s largest data science community. Conceived as a gamified platform for crowdsourced machine-learning challenges, Kaggle is a networked public where users are under constant pressure to produce new and improved algorithms.

This research first engages with Kaggle as a company and platform, offering a narrative of its history and a detailed description of how it works. Combining discourse analysis, software studies, and digital methods, this research aims to understand how code, data, digital infrastructures, crowdsourced labour, and political-economic interests are mobilized to create instruments of control that shape, modulate, and mediate individual behaviour. This phenomenon, which I call modes of automatic subjectivation, points toward the possibility of using subjective and impersonal materials to reorganize life in its broadest sense according to a specific system of power and privileges involving gender, race, sexuality, and social class.

This dissertation argues that these modes of subjectivation are designed to control the “production of possibilities” and reinforce specific types of socioeconomic relations, which in turn reproduce current conditions of existence. Furthermore, this research argues that the data science community has a notable compulsion toward cost reduction, indifference toward human life, an obsession with controlling populations and individual bodies, and a desire to produce a predictable future for economic gain. Ultimately, this research identifies algorithmic media based on AI Technology as a core asset in the attention economy and as a source of power that can be used as an interface to prescribe individual behaviour.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Variation in Effects of Climate Change on Salmonid Demography: Extent, Scale, and Underlying Mechanisms</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gallagher, Brian K.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Predicting species responses to climate change is an increasingly important objective in ecological research and natural resource management. However, heterogeneity in demography, life history, and habitat characteristics across multiple spatial scales can generate substantial diversity in population responses, complicating species-level assessments. Therefore, for widely distributed species consisting of many fragmented populations, understanding the mechanisms that underlie population variation can improve predictions of climate impacts across the species range. Using salmonid fishes as a model system, my thesis investigates variation in population responses to climate change at global, regional, and local scales. First, through a global meta-analysis of 156 studies of 23 species, I demonstrated that population responses to temperature and precipitation exhibit significant spatial, temporal, and biological patterns that broadly align with predictions based on salmonid thermal limits. Importantly, I showed that salmonid populations at low latitudes and elevations tend to be most negatively impacted by rising temperatures. Subsequently, I analyzed mark-recapture and stream temperature data collected during field surveys in Cape Race (Newfoundland, Canada) since 2010 to characterize local-scale variation in demography, climate impacts, and thermal regimes among eleven populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) separated by &lt;5 km. I showed that variation in recruitment, growth, and demographic relationships combined to generate diverse population dynamics that stabilized brook trout abundance across Cape Race, and that thermal regimes driven by groundwater inputs contributed to population diversity. Finally, using population-specific demographic and life history data, I built eco-genetic models that simulated responses to future climate warming across Cape Race brook trout populations, which emphasized the role of life history evolution and thermal habitat variation in determining population persistence. Together, my thesis shows that large-scale gradients in latitude and elevation structure salmonid responses to climate change, but substantial fine-scale variation is embedded within these trends due to heterogeneity in habitat characteristics, human impacts, and eco-evolutionary dynamics experienced by populations. Similar research frameworks that employ diverse methodologies and integrate data across scales will be crucial for understanding the complex impacts of climate change on salmonids and other freshwater fish populations, and should inform the conservation of a wide range of species.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Analyzing the Cryptocurrency Market: Event Studies and Pricing Factors</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gao, Weiyu</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the application of event study methodologies and cross-sectional factors in cryptocurrency markets, with a focus on understanding market dynamics and the drivers of cryptocurrency returns. Through two distinct but complementary studies, this work addresses both the methodological challenges of event studies in highly volatile markets and the role of novel factors in pricing ERC-20 tokens.
The first study examines the suitability of traditional event study methodologies in the context of cryptocurrency markets. Given the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies—such as non-normal return distributions and extreme volatility—the study explores the efficacy of various parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. It identifies non-parametric approaches as more robust, particularly for smaller and highly volatile cryptocurrencies, and highlights the importance of sample size in achieving reliable results.
The second study investigates cross-sectional return predictors in the cryptocurrency market, with a specific focus on ERC-20 tokens. By leveraging both traditional factors such as size and momentum, as well as novel on-chain variables—including transaction value, transfer counts, and active addresses—the study constructs crypto-specific factors that provide deeper insights into token valuation and market behavior. It further demonstrates the relevance of these factors in explaining the variation in token returns.
Collectively, these studies contribute to the growing body of research on cryptocurrency markets by refining event study methodologies and introducing novel factors to better understand market reactions and return dynamics. The findings have broad implications for financial analysis in emerging and volatile asset classes, offering tools for researchers and investors to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency markets.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Sacramental Communities: Atlantic Catholics and Sociopolitical Formations in British Nova Scotia</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gaudet, Colby</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Between 1758 and 1827, Nova Scotia’s Roman Catholics were politically disenfranchised subjects under a British colonial administration. During the late 1750s, the Catholic Acadians – descendants of the French settlers who first occupied the colony in the early seventeenth century – had been deported by the British. By the close of the Seven Years’ War, all Catholic missionaries were also expelled from Nova Scotia. The Church of England was then installed as the colony’s established religion. Some Acadians lingered in remote parts of coastal Nova Scotia, while others returned after a period of exile. Meanwhile, the Indigenous Mi’kmaq – also an historically Catholic people – were impacted by the increasing numbers of Anglo-Protestant settlers arriving in Nova Scotia from New England. Before 1800 especially, the Mi’kmaq and Acadians sometimes went years without access to Catholic clergy. In this thesis, I analyze the ways Catholic communities in Nova Scotia lived under an Anglican establishment until the political ‘emancipation’ of the province’s Catholics in 1827. 

Maritime public memory has long focused on Acadian ancestral piety and the ‘apostolic’ work of colonial missionary priests. During the clerical absences of the late eighteenth century, however, Catholic laypeople in rural Nova Scotia conducted their own sacramental rites. Midwives blessed newborns and laymen led their communities in improvised liturgies. Sacramental rituals socially and spiritually structured parishes located on an Atlantic fringe. These Catholic communities included parishioners of Acadian, Mi’kmaw, and Black Loyalist origins. Parish kinships thus drew the faithful into intimate, familial relations that were sometimes ruptured by defiant behaviour. Parishes also maintained racial and class hierarchies typical of the greater Atlantic as Acadian masters and mistresses oversaw the baptisms and burials of their Black servants. For the Mi’kmaq, demonstrations of Catholic devotion anchored Indigenous land claims amid mounting settler colonization. Treaties and petitions invoked the moral obligations of the colonial administration toward the Mi’kmaq and bound governors, clergymen, and tribal leaders to negotiate state benevolence and relief policies. In the civic domain, Catholic laypeople gave and received charity and leading Acadian men stepped into public offices. Participation in all these aspects of colonial life generated sociopolitical coherence for ethnically diverse Catholic subjects of the revolutionary-era British Empire.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Ultrasonic vocalizations induced by appetitive or aversive clitoral stimulation: foundations for an anticipatory-based model of female sexual reward and clitorodynia.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gerson, Christine</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Adult rats make ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that exhibit acoustic characteristics indicative of an immediate emotional state and its underlying neural activation. As an integral part of the rats' behavioral repertoire, USVs can be translated to human behavior, including clinical models of human diseases and disorders. Although female rats are used as predictive models of sexual function and dysfunction in women, their USVs have not yet been incorporated into existing preclinical behavioral paradigms. Female rats reliably emit USVs in response to the application of temporally-distributed, manual clitoral stimulation (CLS). It is unclear, however, whether the emissions are reflective of the hedonic properties of CLS or those of general arousal. Thus, the experiments in the thesis aimed to characterize the acoustic properties of CLS-elicited USVs to clarify their communicative function. The experiments described in Chapter 2 determined that female rats emit hedonic USVs when distributed CLS is delivered with a soft-bristle paintbrush. The ovarian hormones estradiol and progesterone modulated the acoustic parameters of hedonic USVs whereas chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine attenuated their emission concurrently with decreases in sexually appetitive behaviors like solicitations. The experiments described in Chapter 3 explored whether altering the tactile quality of distributed CLS alters its hedonic value and its capacity to serve as a reinforcer in partner-preference conditioning. Compared to CLS applied with a soft-bristle brush, CLS applied with a hard-bristle brush elicited distinct subtypes of low frequency USVs associated with aversion. The experiment described in Chapter 4 found that the tactile quality of distributed CLS also altered the pattern of Fos protein expression in brain areas involved in sexual reward, aversion, and sensory integration. Exposure to a neutral odour previously associated with rough-bristle CLS increased the number of neurons expressing Fos protein in brain regions subserving aversive responses and decreased expression in regions subserving reward. An opposite pattern was expressed in response to the same odour associated with soft-bristle CLS, whereas the odour associated with sham CLS did not alter Fos expression in those areas. Taken together, the data show that CLS-induced USVs can be used as a measure of both appetitive and aversive sexual affect, as well as provide a foundational model of anticipatory-induced clitorodynia.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Essays on Environmental Cooperation and Trade</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ghandour, Dana</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the relationship between environmental cooperation and trade within heterogeneous countries. Comprising three essays, the research delves into the impact of environmental damage heterogeneity on the stability of environmental coalitions in the presence of exogenous tariffs, the effect of environmental damage heterogeneity on the stability of environmental coalitions in the presence of endogenous tariffs, and the role of unilateral Carbon Border Adjustments (CBAs) in incentivizing environmental cooperation among heterogeneous countries.
The first essay employs a static three-country model to analyze the stability of international environmental agreements among heterogeneous trading partners. The study examines the trade-offs governments face in balancing the enforcement of emissions reductions through higher taxes against the potential consequences of noncooperation in the form of higher exogenous export tariffs. The main findings demonstrate that the grand coalition can be stable across various levels of heterogeneity, while underscoring the critical role of punitive tariffs in determining coalitional stability.
Building upon these insights, the second essay introduces an endogenous solution to the static three-country model, incorporating endogenous import tariffs. The research identifies conditions under which the grand coalition remains stable, showcasing environmental and welfare gains across varying levels of heterogeneity. The study reveals that as market sizes expand, the grand coalition transitions from generating both environmental and welfare gains to primarily fostering only overall welfare gains. 
The third essay shifts focus to the implementation of unilateral CBAs, exemplified by the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Investigating the effects of CBAs in a two-country trade model with different environmental damage parameters, the study assesses their impacts on global welfare and emissions. Novel considerations include the time sensitivity of CBAs, distinguishing between farsighted and myopic approaches, and exploring the potential for retaliation in myopic CBAs. Results show that farsighted CBAs can generate environmental and welfare gains under specific conditions, while myopic CBAs without retaliation offer potential avenues for cooperation. 
Collectively, these essays contribute valuable insights into the intricate interplay of environmental cooperation and trade dynamics, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities presented by free-riding behavior, enforcement challenges, and environmental damage heterogeneity in the pursuit of stable environmental coalitions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Membrane Protein Classification with Protein Language Models</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ghazikhani, Hamed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the application of Protein Language Models (PLMs) to enhance the classification of membrane proteins, which are crucial for cellular functions and pharmacological targeting but challenging to characterize due to their context within a membrane. We employ PLMs derived from Large Language Models of natural language processing, including ProtBERT, ProtT5, ESM1b, ESM2, and Ankh. These PLMs are pretrained using self-supervised learning on extensive datasets such as UniRef50 (40 million proteins) and BFD (2 billion proteins).

Our research comprises four interconnected projects focused on discriminating membrane proteins, transport proteins, and ion channels from proteins not in those classes. We use established state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools with standard datasets for training and testing as a baseline for evaluating our work.

The first project demonstrates that fine-tuning is beneficial in classifying membrane proteins, with a fine-tuned combination of ProtBERT-BFD and logistic regression (LR) outperforming SOTA. The second project shows that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are superior to traditional classifiers when used with PLMs for membrane protein, transport protein and ion channel classification, again surpassing SOTA performance.

In the third project, we evaluate six PLMs and six downstream classifiers across three tasks, considering fine-tuned and frozen representations, dataset balance, and floating-point precision. ESM-1b emerges as the top performer across most tasks and metrics. We confirm that fine-tuning outperforms frozen representations, imbalanced datasets work best, and there is no statistically significant difference between half- and full-precision computations.

The fourth project incorporates secondary structure information into Ankh. Evaluation across multiple tasks shows little statistically significant difference between Ankh and the modified PLM with secondary structure information.

The tools developed in this research now represent the state-of-the-art in membrane protein classification. Our methodological findings provide insights into PLM applications for protein classification in general, with particular relevance to membrane proteins highly relevant to drug discovery.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>“To Create Communities Where Care is Enjoyed and Valued in a Very High Regard”: Motivations, Approaches, and Impacts of Youth-Led Climate Collectives</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ginsburg, Julia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This doctoral dissertation explored youth engagement in climate collectives and how these groups affected participants’ lives, focusing on young people 13–18 years of age in the United States and Canada. Due to people’s concern for the escalating climate crisis, the study examined the following central research question: How do climate-oriented groups led by young people approach climate organizing, and how do the individuals who make up the groups perceive their participation in the movement? The research delved into the intricacies of youth-led climate work through 30 semi-structured individual interviews, weekly participant observation, and two group interviews. Participants were members of climate-oriented collectives, including Extinction Rebellion Youth, Sunrise Movement, Sustainabiliteens, and school-based clubs. Thematically analyzed results are presented in three categories: motivations, group processes, and impacts. Motivations ranged from family and upbringing to a compelling sense of urgency around the climate emergency and a heightened awareness of the global movement. Group processes participants discussed highlighted the diversity in advocacy approaches, emphasizing planning and communication, leadership styles, and outreach. The impacts encompassed nuanced emotions, navigating the challenges inherent in being a young person, perceptions of success, and effects on adolescent identity development. In the discussion section, I propose a frame of reference for comprehending these young people’s contemporary experiences of climate organizing, centering concepts of generativity and meaning-making. This research contributes valuable insights into the effects of climate organizing on young people, stressing the importance of amplifying youth voices in the climate movement and adults’ obligation to provide space for and support these collectives. It underscores the need for educational, civic, and policy frameworks to center young people’s perspectives while empowering youth participation in climate-related decision-making processes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Setting Dopamine's Rhythm: The Role of The Habenula as a Pacemaker for Rhythmic Dopamine</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Goldfarb, Cassandra</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role in regulating a variety of behaviours, including motor function and reward. While the presence of DA is essential, its rhythmic release into regions such as the striatum is equally critical for maintaining normal physiological functions. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that the lateral habenula (LHb) serves as a pacemaker for rhythmic DA release, independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The habenula's circadian pacemaker properties and its projections to the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) suggest it could regulate DA rhythms.
To test this hypothesis, we performed a targeted knockout of Bmal1 in the LHb of male and female mice and assessed the impact on motor and alcohol consumption behaviours. Our findings indicate significant disruptions in motor function, DA levels, and gene expression in the SN and dorsal striatum (DS) following LHb Bmal1 knockout. Specifically, we observed altered rhythms in clock genes and DA-related genes, supporting the LHb's role in regulating DA rhythms.
We further explored therapeutic strategies to mitigate the observed motor deficits using pharmacological (quinpirole) and non-pharmacological (running wheels) interventions. Both interventions improved motor performance, with notable sex-specific responses, highlighting the complexity of motor regulation by circadian mechanisms. However, neither intervention fully restored normal DA levels, suggesting involvement of additional pathways, such as the serotonergic system.
Additionally, we found sexually dimorphic effects on alcohol consumption behaviours following LHb Bmal1 knockout. Male mice showed increased voluntary alcohol intake and binge drinking, while female mice displayed reduced consumption under specific conditions. These results underscore the interaction between the LHb, DA, and serotonin systems in regulating alcohol-related behaviours.
In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the LHb acts as a pacemaker for rhythmic dopamine release, influencing both motor and reward behaviours. The findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between circadian rhythms and the dopaminergic system, with potential implications for the LHb as a novel site for therapeutic interventions targeting both systems. Understanding the role of the LHb in setting DA's rhythms offers a novel perspective on neuronal functioning and circadian biology.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Behavioural and Neural Analyses of Higher-Order Fear Conditioning</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gostolupce, Dilara Esin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Memories about aversive events that elicit fear can imbue fear to other stimuli. This is studied using Pavlovian higher-order fear conditioning. A stimulus that is directly paired with an aversive outcome (i.e., Pavlovian first-order fear conditioning) can support learning about another stimulus (i.e., Pavlovian higher-order fear conditioning). That is, by virtue of its links with a first- order stimulus (i.e., S1), a higher-order stimulus (i.e., S2) controls behaviour by eliciting conditioned defensive responses. This occurs in two ways: either S2 is paired with S1 before the latter is paired with an outcome (i.e., foot shock) as exemplified in sensory preconditioning (SPC), or after S1 is paired with an outcome as exemplified in second-order conditioning (SOC). Reduction in fear to S1 by presenting it in the absence of the shock transfers to sensory preconditioned but not to second-order conditioned fear, showing that two types of fear are supported by distinct behavioural (and neural) structures.
Extensive work investigated the neural substrates underlying first-order fear conditioning, while our understanding of the neural structures mediating higher-order fear conditioning is still relatively limited. The present thesis investigated the role of some of the neural substrates that support sensory preconditioning and second-order conditioning. In Chapter 4 we confirmed that SPC but not SOC required the integrity of first-order fear and provided neural evidence for this dissociation using a chemogenetic approach to delete first-order fear memory, which disrupted SPC but not SOC. In Chapter 5 we investigated the role of lOFC in regulating the expression of both types of fear and showed that lOFC inactivation prior to test disrupted SPC but enhanced SOC. In Chapter 6 we identified the neuronal ensembles that are activated by SPC and SOC in the BLA, a region critical for the expression of fear to SPC and SOC, and showed that a subset of these ensembles showed projections to the lOFC. These projections, when silenced disrupted both types of fear. Lastly, we silenced lOFC input to the BLA and showed that this pathway is crucial for SPC but not SOC. Our findings delineate neurobiological structures differentially supporting SPC and SOC types of fear and characterize the role of lOFC in the fear circuit.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Modeling and Attenuation of Motion Artifacts in Capacitive ECG</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Grando Sirtoli, Vinicius</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>To reduce the burden on the health system and democratize access to health care, current research is aimed at embedding medical devices in daily-life objects with autonomous diagnostic algorithms. In the case of popular tools such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyography (EMG), one of the scientific challenges is replacing the standard wet Ag/AgCl electrode. A strong candidate is the capacitive electrode, which can be seamlessly integrated into chairs, beds, car seats and wearable devices. This is a dry and active kind of electrode, fabricated on a rigid or flexible printed circuit board. Although in ideal conditions capacitive electrodes can provide high-quality biopotential measurements, they are prone to motion artifacts (MAs) because they do not stick to the patient's body. A MA is a large interference that can render the ExG analysis impossible. Often, it is much larger than the targeted signal and it can even saturate the analog front-end's input. MAs are often described as random or unpredictable events, however, in this dissertation they were modeled based on triboelectric nanogenerator theory. The proposed model uses information on displacement and speed to mimic the MA behavior. It also supports existing bibliography that MA comprises two main phenomena, a change in electrode capacitance (capacitance between electrode and patient) and generation of triboelectricity. The electrode capacitance variation can cause voltage division with the input capacitance (reduce signal to noise ratio), low cut-off frequency fluctuation (common-mode signals converted into differential artifacts) and modulation of DC voltages across the electrode capacitance (voltage spikes). To attenuate the effects of electrode capacitance variation, three topologies of capacitive electrode are proposed: i) a through-body negative feedback is applied to stabilize the electrode's gain; ii) the input resistance is boosted with a positive feedback so a series capacitance can be inserted; iii) a control system detects the electrode capacitance change and modifies the input resistance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Alternative game controllers, interfaces, and controls (altctrl) and the games designed around and through them provide novel arrangements of players and games, significantly altering play experiences. Altctrl works can take a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, custom devices coupled with new software and repurposed artifacts or play practices. They have gained cultural momentum through game jams, showcases, and specialized events. While often valued for innovation and entertainment, altctrl practices can also challenge hegemonic conventions, fostering critical, oppositional, and reflective approaches to game making and play. I set out to examine how altctrl articulates alterity and the unconventional, addressing issues of openness, materiality, criticality, and reflection. This effort is in conversation with the fields of critical and reflective game design, game design research, and game production studies. It also aims to benefit altctrl practitioners, students and educators, and game creators.

This research combines mutually informed research-creation and qualitative research approaches. I elaborate a model for understanding altctrl as devices, games and practices, drawing from analysis of primary and secondary interviews with practitioners, online documentation of events and other works, and previous scholarship. I developed research-creation projects focused on criticality and reflectivity: an altctrl game discussing political systems and game interfacing; altctrl devices questioning do-it-yourself and circulation practices; and a set of phone-based altctrl games and tools exploring possible infrastructures for altctrl practice. These projects’ development was carefully documented, allowing for analysis focused on their reflective and critical potentials. The insights from research-creation informed the construction of an expanded set of design qualities to support reflective game design.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Airplanes offered a new form of perception that was not just looking down to the earth from high above the clouds or in orbit, but also standing on the ground, looking up. Airplanes taught observers a new way of learning, absorbing information, and being in the world. In the early decades of aviation, civilian, military, and government programs organized and trained children and adults for the requirements (real and imagined) of the coming air age. These organizations, from the local to the national level—the Boy Scouts, the Civil Aviation Administration, the Ninety-Nines, the Army Air Forces, and the Navy—created communities that supported and developed aviation infrastructure. This dissertation focuses on the age-specific and gendered social labour to imagine, map, and defend the sky and airspace, highlighting how aviation impacted conceptions of scale, from Lindbergh’s flight across the Atlantic to the end of the World War II. 
The first chapter traces the Boy Scouts’ changing ideal of the pilot and the role of boyhood in aviation from Charles Lindbergh through WWII. It looks at how the sky was both imagined as a new frontier for exploration and domesticated and tamed for youth consumption. The second chapter focuses on the development of both commercial and private aviation infrastructure in the interwar period, and the efforts of the women aviators in the Ninety-Nines to build air markers. At stake were two ideas of transportation, and the implications that had for the freedom of the sky. The third chapter examines the Air Warning Service, the Army Air Forces’ domestic defense effort, which asked civilians to watch the skies and track flights across the United States. Both a technical and a social network, the program balanced gendered efforts to bring military values into the home and provide homeland protection. The last chapter examines the multiple ways air recognition was taught during World War II to both civilians and enlisted personnel, focusing on the flash recognition program developed for the military. These efforts reshaped perception to reflect the needs of an increasingly interfaced sky, for a technologically militarized world.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Experimental and Analytical Investigation of Bond between GFRP Bars and Concrete</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The utilization of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars in concrete structures has seen a consistent increase in recent years. This growth is attributed to the properties of FRP bars, including corrosion resistance, low density, fatigue resistance, and high tensile capacity. Among various FRP bars, glass FRP (GFRP) bars have attracted notable interest because of their advantageous characteristics, such as exceptional chemical resistance, cost-effectiveness, and versatile applicability. The bond strength between GFRP bars and concrete is crucial for the serviceability and ultimate performance of GFRP-reinforced concrete (RC) structures. GFRP bars exhibit anisotropy, linear elasticity, and a lower modulus of elasticity compared to steel bars, rendering the design guidelines for steel inapplicable to GFRP. Therefore, a thorough investigation into the bond is essential to ensure effective force transfer between GFRP bars and concrete.
In this thesis, the bond strength and bond-slip behaviour of high-modulus GFRP bars were investigated using pullout and beam splice tests. In Phase 1 of the experimental study, 48 pullout specimens were constructed and tested to investigate the local bond-slip behaviour between single and bundled ribbed GFRP bar in concrete. The study considered the effects of bar embedded length, specimen dimensions, GFRP surface profiles, the presence of steel transverse reinforcement, and bundling of the bars on the pullout strength. The experimental data were used to calibrate existing analytical bond-slip models for ribbed GFRP bars. The calibrated values could be utilized in numerical modelling for concrete elements internally reinforced with ribbed GFRP bar. In second Phase, lap splice tests have been conducted on 20 full-scale beams with a focus on investigating the effects of GFRP bar’s surface profile and GFRP transverse reinforcement on the bond strength. The study evaluated the influence of different surface profiles, including ribbed, sand-coated, and grooved, as well as GFRP stirrup spacing, bar splice length, and bar diameter, on splice strength. A comprehensive dataset was collected from both the literature and the present study to evaluate the reliability of existing bond models. A new model was proposed to enhance bond prediction accuracy. Additionally, the bond contributions of steel and GFRP transverse reinforcement were assessed and compared.
Furthermore, the lower modulus of elasticity in GFRP compared to steel bars leads to increased crack width and deflections in GFRP-RC structures. Consequently, the design of GFRP-RC structures is usually governed by the serviceability limit state. Effective control of crack width during the service stage of GFRP-RC structures is of paramount importance. To address this, the present research also investigated the capability of machine learning (ML) models to predict crack width in GFRP-RC structures, with the aim of enhancing prediction accuracy compared to existing code and literature models. Various ML models, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), gradient boosting (GB), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), Ridge, and Lasso, were utilized to improve the prediction accuracy of crack width in GFRP-RC beams.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Insect herbivory plays a vital role in forest ecosystems, structuring trophic webs and maintaining biodiversity. While dramatic insect outbreaks often dominate attention, low intensity but persistent background herbivory also contributes to ecological processes. This thesis investigates the ecological drivers of background insect herbivory in sugar maple-dominated forests, focusing on within-tree variations, between-tree diversity, and trophic interactions.
Using the "green world" hypothesis as a framework, this study examines how bottom-up and top-down forces shape herbivore populations. Bottom-up pressures from leaf physical traits varied with vertical stratification and light gradients: sunlit canopy leaves exhibited higher thickness, lower specific leaf area (SLA), and lower water content with less herbivory damage, whereas shaded understory leaves showed lower thickness, higher SLA and greater water content with increased herbivory damage. Paradoxically, feeding bioassays revealed that a local lepidopteran herbivore preferred sun-exposed leaves over shaded leaves and had a better performance on sun-exposed leaves. These findings underscore the complex interplay between leaf traits and herbivore behavior, indicating that physical defenses alone cannot fully explain observed patterns of herbivory. 
Top-down forces, including predation and parasitism, were further studied. Predation rates varied across vertical gradients but not between saplings under different light conditions, with arthropods dominating shaded understories and birds in sunlit canopies. While higher bird predation may contribute to reduced herbivory in the sun canopy, limited parasitoids data prevented robust conclusions about vertical variation of natural enemies. These spatially variable top-down pressures on herbivore populations deserves further attention.
Comparisons between sugar maple and black maple (Acer nigrum) revealed key differences in leaf traits, like tougher leaves and denser trichomes in black maples, but no difference in herbivore communities. This suggests that despite notable trait differences, insect herbivores did not distinguish between the two tree species, likely reflecting their close evolutionary relationship.  
By integrating within-tree and between-tree variations with trophic interactions, this thesis provides a comprehensive view of insect herbivory regulation in sugar maple forests. These results refine our understanding of the green world hypothesis by highlighting how spatial variation in plant traits and predator communities shapes herbivore populations. This insight enhances ecological theory and informs forest management strategies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Gradient-Free Aeroacoustic Shape Optimization Using High-Order Implicit Large Eddy Simulation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hamedi, Mohsen</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Aviation noise poses significant challenges to both the quality of life for those living near airports and the sustainable growth of the aviation industry. Accurate aeroacoustic shape optimization methods are required to reduce this noise. To address this, we propose an innovative approach for aeroacoustic shape optimization using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The gradient-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm minimizes sound pressure levels for observers at varying distances. Near-field predictions rely on a high-order unstructured flow solver, while far-field predictions employ an acoustic solver based on the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) time-domain formulation. The acoustic solver is verified and validated using analytical test cases and comparison with results obtained directly from the flow solver. The optimization framework is implemented in parallel, enabling concurrent objective function evaluations at each iteration. This removes the dependency of the computational runtime of the MADS algorithm on the total number of design variables, given the availability of sufficient resources. Different problems are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization framework, including flow over a deep open cavity, tandem cylinders configuration, and a NACA 4-digit airfoil. Initially, noise reduction for a near-field observer is addressed for these geometries under low Reynolds numbers and in two-dimensional settings. Subsequently, the approach is extended to three dimensions, and finally, shape optimization is conducted to minimize noise for a far-field observer. The results affirm the efficacy of the proposed optimization framework by significant noise reduction across all cases.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Focused ultrasound-guided delivery of microRNA-126 to endothelial cells in in vitro and ex vivo models</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>He, Stephanie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemia, underscores the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Recent advances in the field of focused ultrasound offer a non-surgical, targeted, and promising technology to treat various life-threatening diseases, including brain disorders, inoperable cancers and some vascular diseases. This approach harnesses the therapeutic potential of ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles for the modulation of cellular and vascular permeability to guide the delivery of therapeutics. More recently, gene therapy has shown great potential as a less invasive approach in contrast to surgical interventions. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, microRNA-126 is a key target for therapeutic interventions, as it is abundant in endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and plays a pivotal role in promoting angiogenesis. This thesis explores the use of ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles as a non-viral and targeted approach for microRNA-126 delivery to endothelial cells in both in vitro and ex vivo models. First, I designed and characterized a cationic microbubble formulation that can carry a microRNA-126 payload on its surface. I then developed an ultrasound regimen to safely deliver microRNA-126 to endothelial cell suspensions and demonstrated its effect on blood vessel formation in vitro. My results indicate the increase of microRNA-126 in endothelial cells result in the modulation of key downstream proteins, notably PIK3R2 and SPRED1, and improves angiogenesis. Building on these findings, I then developed a more complex vascular model to study ultrasound-guided microRNA-126 delivery by isolating rat mesenteric arteries. This model allowed me to replicate a more physiologically relevant vascular environment ex vivo. By incorporating factors such as intralumenal pressure and fluid flow, this study investigated the effect of focused ultrasound on the vasoconstriction and vasodilation of an artery. My findings revealed a positive relationship between ultrasound-mediated cell permeabilization and increased flow velocity, as well as an inverse relationship between the levels of microRNA-126 delivered with increased flow velocity. These results suggest that understanding hemodynamic conditions in specific anatomic regions could enhance the effectiveness of gene delivery. Overall, this thesis highlights the potential to deliver microRNA-126 using focused ultrasound and microbubbles while minimizing cellular and vascular viability, with anticipation for its application in gene therapy for cardiovascular diseases.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation proposed to investigate the modes of violence (Zizek, 2008) used against teachers in Colombia, what the teachers’ understanding of violence is, and how they interact with or resist it. Through conversaciones, a qualitative method that aligns with oral history methodology, the teachers who participated in this research (hereinafter, research collaborators) and I reflected on their contexts of teaching and living, their understanding of violence, their experiences with violence, and their preparedness for violence. We reflected on practices and knowledge that have the potential to inform the structuring of trauma-sensitive pedagogies for teachers. Moreover, the conversaciones enclose oral histories of what it means to teach and live in conditions of duress, such as those experienced in some regions of Colombia. The research collaborators also elaborated on practices to deal with forms of violence. Such practices are presented as recommendations for teachers and education stakeholders, hoping to be adapted by teachers in other challenging contexts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>BIM-Based Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis of HVAC
Systems Using Knowledge Models</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hosseini Gourabpasi, Arash</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis (AFDD) of building mechanical systems, including HVAC
(Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning), has received substantial attention recently from both research
and application angles. The reasons are attributed to potential savings in energy consumption and
maintenance. Various methods, including simulation and Grey-Box, are offered, but data-driven ones have
received the most attention due to reduced manual effort, integrability, and scalability. Accordingly, to
enhance energy efficiency and reduce operational costs, various Machine Learning (ML) models have
been developed for AFDD of HVAC systems. However, the implementation of such data-driven
approaches has often translated into a loss of contextual data. This study integrates operational data with
building information and its various disciplines, linking the two to facilitate AFDD model development. BIM
(Building Information Model) and BAS/BMS (Building Automation System/Building Management System)
data are the repositories utilized for this integration.
The proposed solution integrates bottom-up (data-driven via Machine Learning) and top-down
(knowledge-oriented via Semantic Web Technologies) AI approaches to generate an effective AFDD
knowledge model. The study materializes a two-way flow of data and knowledge between the BIM and
BMS by utilizing an ontology named AFDDOnto, which integrates building components with fault types,
methods, and parameters. The solution enables AFDD algorithms to utilize static and dynamic information
related to HVAC and building spaces to develop enriched AFDD models. It incorporates building spatial
information and stores analytics to represent the facility's as-is state. The proposed BIM-based knowledge
solution can be used for AFDD model development, tracking changes, and analysis and visualization in
two ways. Firstly, to integrate the BIM features with BMS features for creating ‘context-aware’ AFDD
models. Secondly, to semantically store BIM-based AFDD performance analytics through AFDDOnto that
can be used for model comparison, reproduction and visualization through knowledge graphs.
The knowledge stored in the repository can be queried, which enables access to contextual information
(knowledge graphs, images, videos, project snippets); spatial data (locations, states); and apriori
knowledge (configuration and analytics) to enable development, application, and visualization of context-
aware AFDD models. Additionally, the proposed solution can maintain access to external project files and
databases to enable interoperability between BIM and BAS/BMS. The potential users include HVAC
operators, BIM Managers, and Facility Managers tasked with the operation and maintenance of HVAC
systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The results presented in this thesis contribute to the   understanding of the evolution of smooth, strictly convex, closed hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ driven by non-symmetric speeds on the principal curvatures. The preservation of convexity, the occurrence of singularities, and the asymptotic behavior of the flows are studied. 
After an introduction to geometric flows, Chapter 3 focuses on the  analysis of the short-term and long-term behavior of a contraction flow governed by a non-symmetric speed for rotationally symmetric hypersurfaces. Our investigation reveals two key findings. Firstly, we establish that the flow maintains  convexity throughout the deformation process. Secondly, we observe the development of a singularity within a finite time, leading to the convergence of every such strictly convex hypersurface to a single point.
To investigate the asymptotic behavior of the flow, we employ a proper rescaling technique of the solutions. Through this rescaling, we demonstrate that the rescaled solutions converge subsequentially  to the boundary of a convex  body. In the fourth chapter, we extend our study to the short-term and long-term behavior of a non-symmetric expansion flow in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We show that, starting with a smooth, strictly convex, rotationally symmetric, closed hypersurface,  the flow preserves convexity while expanding infinitely in all directions. Depending on certain parameters within the speed function, we establish that the existence time of the flow can be either finite or infinite. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the flow through a suitable rescaling process and demonstrate the subsequential convergence of the solutions to the boundary of a convex body in the Hausdorff distance. In the fifth chapter, we introduce the most general version of the flow studied in the  Chapter 3. We address the barriers and challenges encountered when transitioning from a symmetric speed to a non-symmetric speed, and present our strategies to  tackle some of these difficulties.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Matching Mechanisms Design for Crowd-Sourced Delivery Under Supply Side Uncertainty</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hou, Shixuan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Crowd-sourced delivery services represent an innovative urban logistics solution that has garnered considerable attention in recent years due to its superior economic, environmental, and social benefits. Distinct from conventional freight transportation, the crowd-sourced delivery model employs ordinary people as either a supplement or an alternative to professional delivery personnel, integrating them into the delivery process. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these non-professional participants, manifested in their strategic refusal of orders, aiming for obtaining better matching outcomes. Furthermore, the prevalent issue of frequent order refusals leads to challenges such as repeated matching and delivery failures, posing significant challenges for the current state of crowd-sourced delivery services. 

Addressing these challenges, this dissertation introduces sophisticated matching mechanisms and compensation schemes for crowd-sourced delivery systems, aiming to optimize outcomes in complex scenarios. The research begins with an empirical investigation into the determinants of driver decisions via a series of stated preference surveys. This foundational work enables the development of an accurate predictive model for driver behavior. Integrating this model into an advanced optimization framework, the study then assesses various matching and compensation strategies, considering factors like acceptance probability and decision-making processes. Further innovation is demonstrated through the proposal of an order-postponement mechanism, informed by the urgency value of deliveries. This approach aims to increase the efficiency of crowd-sourced delivery, accommodating more orders within given time windows. A key contribution of this dissertation is the introduction of the concept of reinforced matching stability. Building on this notion, a novel algorithm is proposed, demonstrably reducing order refusal rates to as low as 1\% and achieving operational cost savings of up to 18\%. This research not only addresses the immediate challenges of crowd-sourced delivery services but also contributes significantly to the broader discourse in urban logistics and transportation planning.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Trajectories of Affective Organizational and Occupational Commitment: The Case of Public Service Employees</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Houle, Simon A.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The goal of this dissertation is to document the evolution of affective organizational and occupational commitment trajectories among public service employees. To this end, three longitudinal person-centered studies were conducted to identify the main types of commitment trajectories identified among three independent samples of participants (i.e., school principals, nurses, military recruits), and to assess how these trajectories were related to a variety of antecedents and outcomes. A first study focused on the occupational commitment trajectories of 661 established school principals (42% males) followed over a period of two years. A second study focused on the organizational commitment trajectories of 4859 military recruits (68.4% males) followed across basic training (3 months) and their first nine months of employment in the Canadian Armed Forces. A third study had a dual focus on the organizational and occupational commitment of 659 early career nurses (12% males), recruited within their first three year of employment, and followed over the course of two years (allowing us to estimate trajectories covering their first five years in the nursing occupation). All three studies identified profiles of employees following persistently high commitment trajectories, persistently low or decreasing commitment trajectories (both of which were identified among school principals) and increasing commitment trajectories. Among school principals and nurses, a persistently moderate commitment trajectory was also identified. Moreover, our results demonstrated the benefits of efficient socialization practices (military recruits, nurses), basic psychological need fulfillment (school principals, nurses), realistic job previews (military recruits) and satisfaction with the implications of military life for work-life balance (military recruits), as well as the harmful nature of experiencing identity conflicts (military recruits). Finally, our results demonstrated the benefits of higher and increasing commitment trajectories for a variety of outcomes, including lower levels of burnout (school principals), psychological distress (nurses), psychosomatic symptoms (nurses), turnover intention (school principals, military recruits), transition intention (military recruits), and higher levels of satisfaction (school principals, military recruits, nurses) and quality of care (nurses). These results suggest multiple avenues to foster desirable commitment trajectories and its associated benefits, which will be highlighted in each of the chapters as well as in the general discussion.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exact and Factor Two Algorithms for Broadcast Time</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hovhannisyan, Narek</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Broadcasting is a fundamental information dissemination primitive in interconnection networks, where a message is passed from one node to all other nodes in the network. Following the increasing interest in interconnection networks, extensive research was dedicated to broadcasting. Two main research goals of this area are finding inexpensive network structures that maintain efficient broadcasting and finding the broadcast time of a given network topology. In the scope of this study, we will mainly focus on determining the broadcast time of a given network. The broadcast time problem on an arbitrary network is known to be NP-hard. We consider this problem on different network topologies and settings.

We begin by studying the broadcast time problem on split graphs. First, we introduce a tight polynomial-time constant approximation algorithm for broadcasting on split graphs. Then, we study some important characteristics of an optimal broadcast scheme on split graphs and design a strategy for generating optimal broadcast schemes. We apply our findings to devise an efficient broadcasting heuristic on split graphs and on natural generalization of split graphs, called (k,l)-graphs.

Next, we study broadcasting on graphs that comprise some recursive structures. We introduce an exact polynomial-time algorithm on closed chains of rings. A closed chain of rings is a sequence of cycles, where every two consecutive cycles, and the first and the last cycles, share a common vertex. Additionally, we initiate a novel direction to designing broadcasting algorithms on recursively defined graphs. We provide a theoretical foundation for future broadcasting research, as well as discuss several practical applications of the approach we introduce.

Last, we study the problem on k-path graphs, one of the simpler graph families with intersecting cycles. To better understand the challenges of broadcasting on arbitrary graphs, families with intersecting cycles are crucial to study. We improve the current best approximation ratio for broadcasting on k-path graphs by a multiplicative factor of two. Further, we propose a new optimization problem called 3-List-Sub, helping us to design an optimal broadcasting algorithm on restricted k-path graphs which was unsolved to date.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, we generalize the p-adic Gross-Zagier formula of Darmon-Rotger on triple
product p-adic L-functions to finite slope families. First, we recall the construction of triple product
p-adic L-functions for finite slope families developed by Andreatta-Iovita. Then we proceed to
compute explicitly the p-adic Abel-Jacobi image of the generalized diagonal cycle. We also
establish a theory of finite polynomial cohomology with coefficients for varieties with good
reduction. It simplifies the computation of the p-adic Abel-Jacobi map and has the potential to be
applied to more general settings. Finally, we show by q-expansion principle that the special value
of the L-function is equal to the Abel-Jacobi image. Hence, we conclude the formula.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Failure Feedback and The Transmission of Gendered Beliefs about Ability</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Iannuccilli, Maxine</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The Brilliance Stereotype associates raw, innate high intellectual ability to men, but not women (Leslie et al., 2015). Such gender stereotyped beliefs about intellectual abilities emerge early (by the age of 6, e.g., Bian et al., 2017), extend into adulthood (e.g., Storage et al., 2020) and can have pernicious effects on behaviour (e.g., Bian et al., 2018; Master et al., 2016). Yet, the sources of development of the brilliance stereotype are seldom investigated. The present research explores the feedback children receive from their parents in response to failure as a potential source of gendered information about intellectual ability.
Across two empirical studies, feedback provided by parents to their 5- and 6-year-old children (NStudy1 = 136; NStudy2 = 114) was recorded as they made their way through a challenging puzzle activity (Study One and Two) described as being for “really really smart kids” (Study Two). Parental feedback was recorded and categorized using a coding scheme I developed based on previous research (e.g., Haimovitz &amp; Dweck, 2016). Feedback utterances were coded as either person-oriented (fixed messages, e.g., “this is too hard for you”), process- oriented (growth messages, e.g., “you need practice”), or other messages (e.g., instructions, statements, questions, product messages). Moreover, parents' mindsets and gender stereotyping attitudes were examined to assess their influence on the feedback provided and their relation to children’s mindsets.
Overall, results from both studies suggest that, in the face of setbacks, parents provide more growth-related messages to boys compared to girls. Specifically, boys received more strategy- and help-focused messages (Study One), as well as more pedagogical questions, product
feedback, and instructions (Study Two). In contrast, girls received less growth-related encouragement in response to failure, which may imply that their efforts are perceived as futile, reinforcing the brilliance stereotype that boys are inherently smarter. Additionally, parents’ mindsets were related to their stereotypical beliefs, yet were not predictive of feedback provided nor did they correlate with children’s implicit beliefs about ability. The findings provide valuable insights about how messages about intellectual ability are communicated within parent-child dynamics, highlighting the potential role of failure feedback in the development of children’s gender stereotypes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The proliferation of IoT has led to vast interconnectivity, generating massive data that exceeds the processing capabilities of IoT devices. Traditional IoT-cloud models, where devices offload computations to centralized cloud servers, are increasingly inadequate due to the expected surge in IoT devices, projected to surpass 75 billion by 2025. This growth intensifies cloud vulnerability to single points of failure and highlights the need for alternatives that meet QoS requirements like low latency and location awareness. The 3-tier IoT-edge-cloud architecture offers a solution by processing data at nearby edge nodes, improving location awareness, and mitigating single-point-of-failure. While this distributed approach meets QoS requirements, it introduces security challenges, such as offloading data to distributed edge nodes without prior registration. Additionally, an adversary can trace the edge node attached to the IoT device and compromise the privacy of an IoT device user. Moreover, many deployed IoT devices are vulnerable to hardware compromise and unauthorized access, raising significant privacy and security concerns that hinder the broader adoption of edge computing.

In this thesis, we address the above challenges by proposing efficient and secure authentication protocols for IoT applications in edge computing. Our proposed protocols include Symmetric Key Authentication with Forward Secrecy (SKAFS), Symmetric Key Inter-Cloud Authentication and Redeemable Micropayment Protocol (SKICAP), Mutual Authentication Privacy-Preserving Protocol with Forward Secrecy (MAPFS), and Conditional Privacy-Preserving Message Authentication for VANET Emergency Exchange (CP-MAVE). The proposed protocols utilize lightweight cryptographic primitives to realize efficient protocols for edge computing. Moreover, the proposed protocols fulfill the security requirements for IoT applications, such as IoT device anonymity, session unlinkability, and resilience to hardware compromise of IoT devices.

For our proposed protocols, we provided formal security analyses based on computationally hard problems. Furthermore, we evaluated their performance in terms of communication overhead and computational complexity and compared them with other closely related protocols. Finally, we implemented prototypes of our proposed protocols using socket programming, simulating the message flow between the protocol entities to calculate their end-to-end latency and confirm the efficiency of our proposed protocols.

        <etd_ms:description>A steel-glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) hybrid reinforced concrete (RC) section would benefit from the superior advantages of steel at serviceability limit states, particular advantages of GFRP at ultimate limit states, and ductility provided by steel reinforcement. Replacing some steel rebars with GFRP bars can reduce the construction costs of the project by lowering the material and labour costs. Moreover, replacing some steel rebars exposed to harsh environmental conditions, such as corners, with GFRP bars can increase the service life of the element. This thesis investigates the serviceability and flexural behaviour of steel-GFRP hybrid RC flexural members through analytical investigations and experimental studies. It also provides design recommendations for designing hybrid RC flexural members and assesses the design equations of deflection, crack width, yielding and ultimate moment capacity in North American standards and guidelines.
This research started with analytical investigations to set a platform for designing steel GFRP hybrid RC sections. Practical design charts were developed for the proposed design recommendation based on the fundamentals of section analysis. An extensive parametric study was undertaken to transform steel RC sections into alternative steel-GFRP hybrid RC sections with the same total number of bars. The study then experimentally investigated the flexural and serviceability behaviour of steel-GFRP hybrid RC beams and one-way slabs through testing and analyzing 15 RC beams and eight RC one-way slabs. The experimental results were analyzed and compared in terms of the first cracking moment and yielding moment, failure modes, flexural capacity, concrete and rebar strain, mid-span deflection, crack width, and ductility. Based on the cracked section analysis, new equations were proposed to estimate the rebar strain and maximum mid-span deflection for the post-yielding stage in the hybrid RC beams. The experimental results were also used to assess the bond-dependant coefficient, kb of the steel, GFRP, and hybrid RC beams and one-way slabs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The effects of minimum wage increases on employment and average wages of affected workers in Canada</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Iray Makvandi, Alaleh</etd_ms:creator>

        <etd_ms:description>The employment effects of the minimum wage are debated among economists, with traditional competitive models suggesting potential job losses for low-wage workers, while alternative models like institutional and dynamic monopsony suggest potential positive impacts. The institutional model posits that raising the minimum wage could boost employment if wages are below the marginal product of labor, and the dynamic monopsony model suggests that higher minimum wages could reduce turnover costs in low-wage labor markets, mitigating predicted job losses. Empirical studies, even within the competitive model, show mixed results, with some indicating significant disemployment effects and others not. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of minimum wage increases on employment and wages across Canada, utilizing a robust methodological framework including the bunching approach, event study analysis, and difference-in-difference methods to examine the effects of varying provincial minimum wages over time.
To accomplish this, I first employ the bunching approach to detect any concentration of wages just above the minimum wage threshold, providing insights into employer behavior in response to wage regulations. This technique identifies subtle adjustments in wage distribution that might not be apparent through other methods. Next, I utilize event study analysis to explore the immediate and long-term effects of minimum wage hikes, comparing employment and wage data from periods before and after the increases. This method captures both short-term disruptions and long-term adjustments in the labor market.  Additionally, the difference-in-difference method is employed to compare outcomes between provinces with and without minimum wage increases, isolating the specific effects of these policies by controlling for other influencing variables. This approach underscores the importance of regional economic conditions in shaping the effectiveness of wage regulations. 
The empirical analysis begins with Labor Force Survey data from Ontario, which experienced significant real minimum wage increases in January 2018. The study estimates the counterfactual frequency distribution of hourly wages in Ontario for three years before and two years after the minimum wage increase. The findings show a significant decrease in jobs paying below the new minimum wage and a proportional increase in jobs paying up to $4 above the real minimum wage, indicating no significant overall employment impact. Contrary to anticipated employment effects, the average wage of affected workers increased significantly by 22.7% over the two years following the minimum wage shock. The only exception in the Ontario study was for the teen group; contrary to much of the existing Canadian literature such as Fossati and Marchand (2024), I found a significant positive employment effect for teenagers. However, overall, I did not observe a significant negative employment effect for young adults.
Further analysis includes other provinces, such as Alberta, and cities such as Gatineau versus Ottawa, which also experienced substantial nominal and real minimum wage increases. The study applies the same methodology to assess the employment and wage effects, finding similar results to the Ontario study. Contrary to the Ontario study, in the Alberta study, I found a significant negative employment effect for the teen group, but overall, I did not find a significant negative employment effect for young adults. Since referring to a single minimum wage is inherently problematic, I also investigated a pooled analysis of hourly wage data from all Canadian provinces from 1999 to 2019. This analysis, covering 56 minimum wage increases, reveals no significant employment effect (-2%) over six months following minimum wage increases but a significant average wage increase (6.4%) for affected workers.

The study also investigates potential employment shifts from low-skilled to high-skilled workers, finding no indication of such shifts. Subgroup analyses by education level, age, and other demographics show approximately similar employment and wage effects, suggesting that the consequences of minimum wage policies are shared among different worker groups. Additionally, sectoral analyses show no negative employment effect in the food industry, aligning with Card and Krueger (1993)’s findings on the impact of minimum wage increases in the fast-food industry. However, a significant negative employment effect (-4%) was observed in the retail sector, highlighting the influence of local industry composition on minimum wage impacts.
Finally, in the Canada study (pooling all 56 minimum wage increase across all provinces), I assess the size of wage spillovers, finding that only 7% of the impact on average wages of affected workers comes from wage spillovers at the lower part of the wage distribution, which was statistically insignificant. This aligns with Canadian literature, such as Campolieti (2015), which found modest wage spillovers based on Canadian data compared to American data. Overall, this thesis provides robust evidence on the employment and wage effects of minimum wage increases in Canada. The findings suggest that, contrary to the traditional competitive model, minimum wage increases do not significantly reduce overall employment of low-wage workers and can lead to substantial wage gains for them. This has important implications for policymakers considering minimum wage adjustments to improve labor market outcomes for low-wage workers.</etd_ms:description>

Maximizing the High-Frequency Subband Energy and
Classification of Alzheimer's Disease using Local and Global
Contextual CNN Features of Neuroimaging Data</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Neuroimaging fusion is the process of combining brain imaging data from multiple imaging modalities to create a composite image containing complementary information such as structural and functional changes in the brain. Recent advancements in transform domain fusion are promising, but challenges remain in accurately representing empirical distributions and maximizing energy in fused images. The most common neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer’s disease, which demands accurate detection and classification for the care of the patient. Recent advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based methods often overlook local features and do not pay attention to the discriminability of extracted features for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, existing architectures often end up using numerous parameters to enhance feature richness.
The objective of this thesis has two parts. In the first part, a novel statistically driven approach for fusing multimodal neuroimaging data is developed. In the second part, a lightweight deep CNN capable of extracting both local and global contextual features for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease is proposed.
In the first part of the thesis, a novel multimodal fusion algorithm using statistical properties of nonsubsampled shearlet transform coefficients and an energy maximization fusion rule is developed. The Student’s t probability density function is used to model heavy-tailed non-Gaussian statistics of empirical coefficients. This model is then employed to develop a maximum a posteriori estimator to obtain noise-free coefficients. Finally, a novel fusion rule is proposed for obtaining fused coefficients by maximizing the energy in the high-frequency subbands.
In the second part of the thesis, a novel lightweight deep CNN that extracts local and global contextual features for Alzheimer’s disease classification is proposed. The network is designed to process local and global features separately using specialized modules that enhance feature extraction relevant to the disease. Finally, the impact of fused images, obtained using the fusion approach of the first part, on the classification accuracy of Alzheimer’s disease is investigated.
Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the various ideas and strategies proposed in this thesis for developing multimodal neuroimaging fusion and Alzheimer’s disease classification schemes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Development of a Resuspension Technique for Heavy Metal Remediation of a Shallow Contaminated Harbour</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Javid, Masoumeh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Heavy metal pollution is an anthropogenic unavoidable issue with implications for life. Heavy metals are natural occurring elements, having both natural and anthropogenic sources. Sediment and soil contamination with toxic heavy metals, including (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb), represents a major long-term remediation challenge. A surface sediment sample (&lt;10 cm) was collected from shallow harbour on the bank of the St. Lawrence River, in Quebec, Canada in 2019 and 2021 for a sediment decontamination study. Harbour sediment from the St. Lawrence River, in Quebec is anthropogenically polluted by heavy metals. To evaluate the metal pollution in this area, the total concentrations of heavy metals in selected stations were analyzed.  A series of laboratory-based experiments under various conditions were performed using designed reactor in order to provide information for sediment remediation technology development. The concept of the resuspension method is that finer sediments have a greater tendency to adsorb the contamination. We are therefore developing a sediment-treatment process based on heavy metal removal by resuspension technique. Sequential extraction procedures were used on the sediment to determine the speciation of the heavy metals before remediation and in the suspended particle matter (SPM). The resuspension method was successful in reducing the concentration of seven selected heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb) by removing just 2.63% of the contaminated sediment (2019). Removal efficiency values on average were positive for all heavy metals (with a minimum 3.48% for Cd and a maximum of 32.4% for Cu). The results of the sequential extraction tests implied that the resuspension technique is capable of decreasing the risk of remobilization of heavy metals in the aquatic ecosystem. The effects of heavy metals on survival and growth of midge Chironomus riparius and Hyalella azteca were investigated. Both larval survival and growth did not show significantly difference between sediment samples (before remediation, after remediation and SPM) with controls. Therefore, exposure of Chironomus riparius and Hyalella azteca larvae to sediments collected in the St. Lawrence River did not have any toxic effects according to the results. 
The resuspension method showed desirable results for the removal of heavy metals from bottom sediments (2019). A small amount of sediment removed from the system, and no chemical substances were employed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Advancements in model combination and uncertainty quantification with applications in actuarial science</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jessup, Sébastien</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, we focus on model combination, incorporating elements of uncertainty quantification to address different actuarial science issues. We first tackle the issue of overconfidence from a single model combination approach, highlighting how different combination assumptions can lead to different conclusions about the predicted variable. This is illustrated with an extreme precipitation example for the regions of Montreal and Quebec. We then focus on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), a very popular model combination technique relying on Bayes' theorem to attribute weights to models based on the likelihood that the observed data comes from the models considered. We propose a correction to the classical expectation-maximisation algorithm to account for data uncertainty, where we assume that the observed data is in fact not the only possible observable data. We then generalise our method to include Dirichlet regression, allowing for combination weights to vary depending on risk characteristics. These BMA approaches are applied to a simulation study as well as a simulated actuarial database and are shown to be very promising, as they allow for a more formal model combination framework for combining actuarial reserving methods in a smooth way based on predictive variables. Next, we adapt Bayesian model averaging using Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation to extreme value mixture models, and show that this modification allows for identifiying the "best" extreme value threshold, although a combination of models will outperform the single best mixture model. This is illustrated using the Danish reinsurance dataset. Finally, we show that the generalised BMA algorithm can be used to identify flexible extreme value thresholds depending on predictive variables. We use this generalised mixture model combination on a recent dataset from a Canadian automobile insurer.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Computational Design of Hammerhead Ribozymes for Logic Computing and Disease Treatment</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kamel, Nicolas</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the intersection of two techniques: evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and allosteric ribozymes (ARs). EAs are population-based search heuristics inspired by natural evolution and ARs are catalytic non-coding RNA (ncRNA) whose activity can be modulated via shape changes induced by external molecules. We present two EAs that design biological devices based on ARs. The first, TruthSeqEr, designs ribogates, logic gates that take short RNA strands as inputs and produce a short RNA output strand as output. Compared to existing approaches, TruthSeqEr is easy-to-use and produces ribogates that are more versatile and that have a greater computational capacity. In silico results show that TruthSeqEr successfully designs ribogates implementing all instances from representative sets of 1, 2, and 3-input functions, including linearly inseparable functions. Motivated by a desire to understand these complex ribogates at an intuitive level, we developed an abstract model that represents each ribogate as a small graph. Analysis of these graphs showed that
ribogates can be classified into families of varying complexity based on shared structural motifs and that ribogates act as a more general version of an artificial neuron. Our second EA, TriCleaver, designs selective ribozymes (sRzs) that cleave the pathogenic mutant mRNA transcript associated with a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder (TRED) while leaving the functional wild-type (WT) transcript intact. TREDs are debilitating genetic disorders
that result in a severe reduction in quality of life, and in many cases, death. In silico results reveal that compared to existing approaches, TriCleaver is more general, being able to design sRzs that target TREDs in which the mutant is much longer than the WT, as well as TREDs in which the mutant and WT are close in length. In addition, in vitro results in mammalian cells showed that two sRzs designed by TriCleaver selectively silenced the mutant transcript associated with a TRED called OPMD. Altogether, these results highlight the therapeutic promise of combining EAs and ARs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>“Your Why for Life”: Understanding the Benefits, Mechanisms, and Maintenance of Purpose in Life</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Karbainova, Daria</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>It was been suggested that “if you have your why for life, you can get by with almost any how” (Nietzsche, 1889/1997, p. 6). Purpose in life is the “why”, the viewpoint that your life has personal meaning and direction (Ryff, 2014). Numerous studies have found empirical support for the abundance of benefits that are associated with having a sense of purpose, including its positive effects on mental and physical health (e.g., Boyle et al., 2012), as well as its ties to other adaptive traits, such as gratitude, compassion, and grit (Damon &amp; Malin, 2020). However, gaps in the research literature remain in terms of particular populations that may benefit from purpose, when it might be effective, how it functions, and how it is maintained. The current investigation into purpose in life was done across three studies, with a particular focus on the emerging adulthood period of the lifespan, which some have argued is a time of inherent purposeful exploration and development (Pfund et al., 2020). Using longitudinal multilevel modeling in study 1, the benefits of purpose in life were explored during a transitional period in emerging adulthood, namely the passage from postsecondary studies to employment. It was found that a greater sense of purpose in life helps emerging adults during this often challenging transition, by allowing them to appraise their employment situation more positively. In study 2, with a cross-sectional design, results indicated that a greater sense of purpose was associated with lower rates of distress among university students in the face of a global stressful event (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic). Notably, a stronger purpose in life allowed emerging adults to engage in adaptive strategies such as positive reframing and appraising a stressful event as less threatening to oneself, thus reporting lower distress. Lastly, in study 3, a longitudinal structural equation model showed that, by engaging in acceptance-based meaning making strategies, university students were able to sustain their sense of purpose during an unprecedented global health crisis. These findings aim to inform future interventions and research into how individuals may develop a purpose in life and experience its benefits.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Three Essays on R&amp;D Competition with Spillovers: Theory and Experiment</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kassab, Sinda</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis consists of three chapters. The first chapter reports a laboratory experiment on dynamic patent races in an indefinite horizon with complete information. In the experiment, we examine how the players react to a leader/follower or symmetric/asymmetric position as well as the distance between the initial knowledge stock and the target. Our results show that the individual average effort is highest for the players who are in a tie position, second highest for the leaders and lowest for the followers and the spillovers in the previous round significantly increase the players’ investment in the current round. By comparing the first and second half of the session, we observe an overall learning effect on the pure-strategy equilibrium play, but efficiency loss remains throughout the session. 

The second chapter investigates the effect of R&amp;D subsidies on the innovating firms’ quality investment choices and profits as well as social welfare in a duopoly market with product substitutability, demand spillovers and consumers’ quality sensitivity. Taking the non-cooperative and cooperative scenarios into account, the optimal R&amp;D subsidy levels are solved in a way to maximize the social welfare. Compared with no-subsidy, the firms are better off under the R&amp;D subsidy policy. Furthermore, it is always socially beneficial to subsidize the non-cooperative regime or the cooperative agreement.

The third chapter considers a two-stage strategic R&amp;D model in a duopoly market. In the first stage, two firms decide simultaneously whether to compete or to cooperate by choosing the level of R&amp;D investment that might decrease the investing firm’s production cost and the rival’s cost through the absorptive capacity. In the second stage, after observing the R&amp;D outcome, the two firms play the classical Cournot in order to maximize their own profits. Under the stochastic R&amp;D technology with low or high symmetric absorptive capacity, I find that the difference between the optimal R&amp;D expenditures under defection and those under cooperation becomes larger as the probability of success increases. Regardless of whether the absorptive capacities of the two firms are same or different, except at the critical threshold, the R&amp;D outcomes always align with the prisoner's dilemma situation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Multimethod Investigation of Beliefs about Losing Control in Anxiety-Related Disorders</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Maladaptive beliefs are proposed to be critical in the development and maintenance of anxiety-related disorders. One commonly reported maladaptive belief domain concerns negative beliefs people hold about losing control. These concerns about the likelihood and consequences of losing control over one’s behaviour, thoughts, emotions and/or physical reactions appear to be prevalent in clinical and non-clinical samples. This program of research aimed to better assess, define and delineate the nature of these beliefs using a multi-method approach. In Study 1, undergraduate psychology students (N = 126) were given false feedback that they were either at high or low risk of losing control, and then completed a social interaction task with an actor. The belief that one was at high risk of losing control led to greater anticipatory anxiety leading up to the social interaction task, significant doubt about one’s social performance and significantly more negative post-event processing. In Study 2, an unselected sample of undergraduate participants (N = 21), half of whom met criteria for one or more anxiety-related disorders, was interviewed about their beliefs about losing control. Losses were defined as negative, multifaceted cognitive-behavioural phenomena which included thoughts, behaviours and emotions. Common consequences were perceived harm to oneself or others, powerlessness, and unpleasant emotions during (e.g., sadness, frustration, anxiety) and following (e.g., regret, shame, humiliation) a reported loss of control. In Study 3, undergraduate students (N = 440) completed an expanded set of items designed to better measure maladaptive beliefs about losing control, leading to the assessment of the Beliefs About Losing Control Inventory, Second Edition (BALCI-II). An exploratory factor analysis indicated the BALCI-II captured several domains of feared consequences of losing control: 1) overwhelming emotions 2) dangerous behaviour and 3) madness and 4) inflated beliefs about probability/severity of those losses. The BALCI-II was found to be psychometrically sound and predictive of symptoms of OCD and SAD, above and beyond existing disorder-specific maladaptive beliefs. Implications for cognitive theory and therapy are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Making/Meat/Matter critiques the intersections of modernity, coloniality, and design within industrial animal-agriculture, exposing how Western ideologies drive exploitative practices that commodify both human and non-human life. This interdisciplinary thesis reveals how industrial systems perpetuate environmental degradation, inequality, and violence by reducing animals to resources and marginalizing communities within capitalist frameworks. Using Design Justice frameworks and ecofeminist theories, it advocates for ethical multispecies coexistence, sustainability, and social equity.
	The thesis comprises two parts: Part I explores the historical and philosophical foundations of modernity, and its ties to colonial exploitation and industrial agriculture. It challenges the anthropocentric logic behind Western systems and their ecological harms. Part II translates these critiques into a design, a tabletop game called Making/Meat/Matter, which encourages players to examine industrial food systems and the ethical issues within.
	This research-creation project bridges theory and practice by integrating design, sociology, marketing, and food studies to challenge entrenched systems and promote sustainable alternatives. By uniting these disciplines, Making/Meat/Matter positions design as a vehicle for interdisciplinary inquiry, using creative tools to engage with complex issues of identity, power, and ethical consumption. This synthesis expands the conversation on how design, when interwoven with diverse fields, can address contemporary social and environmental crises in industrial agriculture, food systems, and beyond.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Advanced Stochastic Programming and Machine Learning
Models for Healthcare Planning, Scheduling, and
Prediction Problems</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The increasing demand for global healthcare systems highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions. In response to this challenge, we uses advanced Stochastic Programming and Machine Learning methods to introduce significant improvements in appointment scheduling, operating room planning, and modeling and prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the first paper, we study the healthcare appointment scheduling problem. The main challenges in appointment scheduling are uncertainties in no-shows, unpunctuality, and service times. We propose a novel stochastic programming model that captures an exponential number of scenarios using a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and constraints without relying on sampling methods. The presented methodology is exact. We show that the generated schedules reduce total costs by 34% on average by incorporating patient-dependent service times, 12% by considering patient-and-time-dependent unpunctuality, and 67% by integrating patient-and-time-dependent no-shows. In addition, we show that personalized reminders have the potential to reduce total costs by 23%.

In the second paper, we study a stochastic operating room planning problem. The unpredictability of surgical durations poses a considerable challenge to efficient OR planning. Existing models often overlook this source of uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel stochastic programming model that effectively manages the uncertainty in surgical times. This model advances the literature by capturing an exponential number of scenarios in a weekly operating room planning problem without sampling, simplifications, or approximations. The results of the computational experiments revealed that our model obtains feasible solutions with an average optimality gap of 0.78% for instances with 80 surgeries and 1.48E+64 scenarios.

In the third, fourth and fifth papers, we focus on modeling and prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic and aim at developing methodologies that inform and guide public health decisions. In these three papers, we proposed a hybrid reinforcement learning based algorithm as well as two other evolutionary computation based algorithms to forecast the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. By applying these methods to real-world data from Canada, Quebec, Ontario, France and the U.S., we aim to offer insights into effective pandemic response strategies. We predict the pandemic trajectory as well as the number of different cases with high accuracy.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Machine Learning-Driven Strategies for Efficient Traffic Congestion Management</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Khasawneh, Mohammed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Urban regions have a notable obstacle in the form of traffic congestion, which results in longer trip durations, higher fuel usage, and increased pollution levels. This study aims to tackle this issue by presenting a three step approach. The first approach uses Machine learning for Proactive Traffic Congestion Prediction. We explore multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Decision Tree (DT), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), to predict traffic congestion levels in different zones of the Montreal area. The results indicate that the Decision Tree approach surpasses other algorithms, attaining faster convergence, lower loss values, and a considerably higher R2 score. After predicting the congestion using one of the prediction algorithms mentioned above, metaheuristic optimization algorithms are used to find near optimal cycle time for each
traffic light. In step 2 Enhanced Bat Algorithm (EBAT) is proposed to adaptively modify traffic signal timings based on expected congestion levels. The EBAT algorithm utilizes adaptive parameter adjustment and guided exploration techniques that are dependent on the expected congestion. This results in enhanced performance when compared to the conventional Bat Algorithm. We conduct a comparative analysis of EBAT with various meta-heuristics, namely Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO), Cuckoo Search (CS), JAYA, Sine Cosine Optimization (SCO), and Harris Haws Optimization (HHO). The evaluation considers three scenarios: fixed-time traffic lights (baseline), dynamic traffic lights without prediction, and dynamic traffic lights with predicted congestion. The results demonstrate that EBAT yields substantial enhancements in both the rate at which convergence is achieved and the quality of the solutions, as compared to fixed and non-predictive scenarios. The second approach is using Multilevel Learning for Enhanced Prediction Accuracy. The precision of predicting traffic congestion depends on the ability to recognize and manage abnormal traffic patterns, especially in highly populated regions. Traditional prediction methods are vulnerable to these anomalies, as they frequently do not handle or clean the data. This can result in inaccurate forecasts, as the data may encompass anomalous occurrences such as accidents or unforeseen road closures,
which can greatly distort the underlying trends. The study presents a novel and creative strategy to learning at several levels, which combines anomaly detection and ensemble learning approaches to
tackle this problem. Anomaly detection techniques are used to find abnormal patterns within the data, which is then followed by the process of data cleansing. First, a set of initial learner models are trained. The top-performing models are then selected for an ensemble procedure, which involves combining their predictions through stacking and voting. Evaluated using a real-world Montreal traffic dataset, this multilevel methodology demonstrates higher prediction accuracy when compared to traditional approaches. The dataset is subjected to preprocessing techniques, such as windowing, to transform time-series data into frequency patterns in order to create a more generalized model. To leverage the detected anomalies, we utilized clustering algorithms, specifically K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, to segment these anomalies. Each clustering algorithm was used to determine the optimal number of clusters. Subsequently, we characterized these clusters through detailed visualization and mapped them according to their unique characteristics. This approach not only identifies traffic anomalies effectively but also provides a comprehensive understanding of their spatial and temporal distributions, which is crucial for traffic management and urban planning. In summary, this study showcases the efficacy of a synergistic method that combines machine learning
for proactive prediction of traffic congestion with metaheuristics for dynamic regulation of traffic lights. This method has the capacity to mitigate urban traffic congestion and enhance traffic flow efficiency. In addition, the use of a multilevel learning strategy to improve forecast accuracy is a noteworthy contribution to intelligent transportation systems. An application for city of Montreal is provided.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Experimental and Theoretical Study of Vibration-Assisted Thermal Bonding of Thermoplastic Composites</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Khodaei, Arash</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Vibration Assisted Thermal Bonding (VATB), CF/PEEK thermoplastic composites, Shear strength</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Thermoplastic composites excel in fatigue and impact resistance over thermoset composites. In particular, they possess the unique possibility for in-situ consolidation using the Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) which reduce manufacturing costs and energy. However, challenges remain in achieving high-quality AFP-made laminates especially in addressing lower bond strength compared to autoclave method. Comprehensive understanding is crucial to overcome these challenges.
Microscopic observation reveals that thermoplastic composite consolidation involves two main stages: intimate contact between two surfaces in which the interfacial contacted area increases by spreading the softened surface, and healing, which refers to intermolecular diffusion across the interfaces of two layers which are in intimate contact. Therefore, this study initially focuses on understanding these consolidation stages thoroughly. Reviewing literature identifies two significant gaps in the consolidation process.
Regarding intimate contact, numerous theoretical models have been proposed to study its development across various manufacturing processes. However, there are very few experimental methods available to measure the degree of intimate contact. To fill this gap, the first part of this study proposes a new experimental technique called Bearing Area Curve (BAC) based on the topology of the tape surface for measuring
intimate contact development. This method evaluates the effects of process parameters like placement speed and temperature on intimate contact development, showing promise in accurately measuring intimate contact.
Regarding healing, despite numerous experimental techniques and theoretical models proposed to optimize the process, the healing obtained from AFP is still unacceptable. To address this, the second part of the study focuses on developing a new experimental technique called Vibration-Assisted Thermal Bonding (VATB) to effectively improve the degree of healing. Further to this, a new healing model is developed to
predict the degree of healing for the VATB process.
The final segment of this investigation extends the developed methodologies, specifically evaluating the effectiveness of vibration-assisted thermal bonding in repairing thermoplastic composites with an integrated amorphous polymer layer such as Poly-Ether-Imide (PEI) between CF/PEEK layers. The results showed that using vibration-assisted thermal repairing (VATR) rather than thermal repairing increases the bonding strength by up to 22% and decreases the void content by up to 35%.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Understanding Test Code Quality from Perspective of Test Code Design and Maintenance</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kim, Dong Jae</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Software testing is vital for ensuring software reliability and robustness. It involves executing a program and verifying it against developer-defined criteria to identify and fix deviations, aiming for fault-free software. Despite extensive research on automated test prioritization, fault localization, and program repair, test design and maintenance remain under-explored. This dissertation aims to understand test code quality from the perspective of design and maintenance practices, exploring various aspects of test design through manual classification, quantitative methods, and automated approaches.

The first part of the dissertation examines test smells, which are design issues that impact test code comprehension and maintainability. Although widely accepted in academia, it is unclear whether developers address test smells in practice. The thesis investigates developers' awareness of test smells and their impact on defect-proneness. Findings reveal that many proposed test smells persist and are removed incidentally through code deletion and refactoring, with minimal effect on software defect density. This dissertation aims to provide empirical support for re-ranking current test smell catalogs.

As test automation grows, modern frameworks like JUnit and TestNG are increasingly used in Java-based systems. These frameworks introduce annotation-driven development, which manages crucial aspects of the test execution lifecycle. Our second aim is to use mining software repository techniques to provide insights into how modern testing frameworks are used to improve test code design and maintenance. First, we investigate annotation usage in test code, providing a manual classification of their API usage and misuses (e.g., test smells). Second, we conduct a detailed empirical analysis of one controversial practice: disabling tests using JUnit and TestNG's @Ignore annotation. While this alleviates maintenance challenges, it introduces technical debt as it does not validate software quality. Finally, we examine the tradeoffs between reusability and redundancy in test code practices, particularly through inheritance, highlighting issues in test increasing test execution time.

Through case studies and experiments, the techniques proposed in this dissertation offer new insights into test code quality that may guide the development of automated tool support in the future, which may help developers improve test maintenance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Advancements in Topic Modeling: Integrating Bi-Directional Recurrent Attentional Models, Neural Embeddings, and Flexible Distributions</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>A primary objective in natural language processing is the classification of texts into discrete categories. Topic models and mixture models are indispensable tools for this task, as they both acquire patterns from data in an unsupervised manner. Several extensions to established topic modeling frameworks are introduced by incorporating more flexible priors and advanced inference methods to enhance performance in text document analysis. The Multinomial Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) framework, a Dirichlet-based model, is extended by integrating generalized Dirichlet (GD) and Beta-Liouville (BL) distributions, resulting in GDMPCA and BLMPCA models. These priors address the limitations of the Dirichlet prior, such as its independent assumption within components and restricted covariance structure. Efficiency is further improved by implementing variational Bayesian inference and collapsed Gibbs sampling for fast and accurate parameter estimation.

Enhancements to the Bi-Directional Recurrent Attentional Topic Model (bi-RATM) are made by incorporating GD and BL distributions, leading to GD-bi-RATM and BL-bi-RATM models. These models leverage attention mechanisms to model relationships between sentences, offering higher flexibility and improved performance in document embedding tasks.

Extensions to the Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (DMR) and deep Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (dDMR) approaches are achieved by incorporating GD and BL distributions. This integration addresses limitations related to handling complex data structures and overfitting, with collapsed Gibbs sampling providing an efficient method for parameter inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate enhanced topic modeling performance, particularly in handling complex data structures and reducing overfitting.

Novel approaches are developed by integrating embeddings derived from Bert-Topic with the multi-grain clustering topic model (MGCTM). Recognizing the hierarchical and multi-scale nature of topics, these methods utilize MGCTM to capture topic structures at multiple levels of granularity. By incorporating GD and BL distributions, the expressiveness and flexibility of MGCTM are enhanced. Experiments on various datasets show superior topic coherence and granularity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Overall, the proposed models exhibit improved interpretability and effectiveness in various natural language processing and machine learning applications, showcasing the potential of combining neural embeddings with advanced probabilistic modeling techniques.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines the persistence of the housing crisis in Nunavik, Quebec by conducting an in-depth analysis of government policies and social, cultural, and economic motivations. Using a phronetic research approach based on Bent Flyvberg’s work, the analysis is conducted using ethical knowledge and “practical common sense” (known as phronesis) to derive an interpretation of the status of values and interests expressed in housing policies, agreements, and Inuit-Crown partnerships. The analysis reveals a disconnect between the intentions and promises made by governments and the programs and actions actually proposed, evidenced in the details of the actual policies and plans. The major gap is found in the goal towards wellbeing, a term that is neither well-defined nor Inuit-specific in government policies. Moreover, the foundational role of housing in Inuit wellbeing is not understood. Assumptions made about what wellbeing means and how it can be reached are largely influenced by neoliberal policies that identify solutions in economic terms. Inuit housing is framed by a capitalist welfare model that responds to housing needs rather than housing as a right. Housing is dealt with through social policy. In this context, the story of social housing as welfare, as a response to poverty, and as a drain on government resources, can only be countered with a discourse of housing as an economic asset. However, I argue that reducing the housing discourse to economic terms and technical issues (such as questions about construction and logistics) leaves no room to insist on critical political issues related to housing such as autonomy, control, and self- determination. Housing is political. It is part of the larger Inuit-state relationship framed by legal, constitutional, and policy contexts. By expressing the political, historical, and cultural contexts of the housing discourse, I survey the vast potential of the idea of home as a new focal point. Shifting from housing to home opens the door to reflect on housing for Inuit wellbeing and for self-determination. Building on Julia Christensen’s work with northern Indigenous populations that showed the material, relational, emotional, and spiritual qualities of homemaking, I explore the idea of home in detail from the literature and from reflections drawn from Inuit sources. Because home is part of what makes us human, something everyone can relate to at some level, and because home is also political, I suggest that it has the potential to change the housing dialogue and bring ethics, justice, care, and the shared value of mutual respect as key themes to include in Inuit housing decisions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Les adolescent·e·s d’aujourd’hui évoluent au contact des technologies mobiles et de réseau qui leur permettent de socialiser et de partager du contenu à tout instant, en tout lieu. Bien que cette hyperconnexion soit de plus en plus étudiée par la recherche, il ne semble pas y avoir de consensus sur ses bénéfices et ses revers. Ainsi, cette thèse se penche sur une réponse critique à cette problématique dans le champ de l’éducation artistique. Par le détournement technologique, cette recherche intègre ces technologies au cœur d’une intervention pédagogique en classe d’art au secondaire afin de mobiliser la corporéité des adolescent·e·s pour la création artistique. Son cadre conceptuel se déploie autour des notions de coprésence virtuelle continue, de spatialité et de mobilité appliquée à l’éducation, de détournement, de pédagogie de la corporéité et de multimodalité.
Au moyen de la recherche design en éducation, cette recherche a été menée avec quatre groupes et deux enseignantes en arts plastiques et multimédia dans deux écoles secondaires de la grande région de Montréal. Centrale au design éducatif, la corporéité de l’élève y est entrevue comme une tactique. Des missions de création performatives ont invité les élèves à produire et à publier une multitude de créations numériques multimodales au sein d’un réseau social éducatif en circuit fermé. Ces missions leur ont permis de créer en prêtant attention à leur corps, à leur sensorialité, à leur environnement ainsi qu’à leurs pairs. Les données de recherche résident dans les créations numériques multimodales des élèves ainsi que dans des entretiens avec les élèves et les enseignantes. 
Si la pandémie de Covid-19 a ramené à l’avant-plan la saturation des pratiques en ligne des jeunes, les principaux résultats de cette recherche apportent un éclairage nouveau sur des rapports sensibles qu’ils peuvent y vivre. Ces résultats démontrent que l’usage des technologies mobiles et de réseau en classe d’art, organisé autour de la corporéité, donnent la possibilité aux élèves d’être présents à leur environnement et d’observer, de ressentir, de réfléchir et de créer d’une manière renouvelée. La mobilisation du corps opère un renversement de la démarche de création artistique habituellement vécue en classe d’art en mettant de l’avant la prise de risques et la multiplication des créations numériques multimodales spontanées. La coprésence virtuelle continue, qui caractérise l’hyperconnexion des adolescent·e·s, participe à une expérience artistique qui les met en contact avec l’univers personnel de leurs pairs. Dès lors, chaque élève délimite les frontières de son intimité et fait des choix sur ce qu’il ou elle souhaite montrer. Enfin, ce type d’intervention contribue à rapprocher l’enseignement des arts plastiques et multimédia au secondaire des pratiques artistiques actuelles tournées autant vers les processus que les productions.

Today’s teenagers are growing up with mobile and network technologies that enable them to socialize and share content anytime and anywhere. While this kind of hyperconnection is increasingly studied by research, there is no consensus on its benefits or drawbacks. Thus, this dissertation focuses on providing a critical response to this issue in art education. Through a technological détournement, the research integrates these technologies into an educational intervention within secondary school art classes to activate teenagers’ sense of corporeality in art making. It is a conceptual framework that revolves around continuous virtual co-presence, spatiality and mobility applied to education, détournement, embodied pedagogy, and multimodality.
Using design-based research, the study was conducted with four groups and two visual arts teachers in two secondary schools in the Greater Montréal area. The students' corporeality is central to educational design. Performative creative missions invited students to produce and post many multimodal digital compositions within a closed educational, social network. The missions awakened them to their bodies, sensoriality, environment, and peers. The students’ multimodal digital compositions, as well as interviews with students and teachers, make up the data of this research.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront the saturation of teens’ online practices, the main findings of this research shed light on new and significant experiences they may have online. This study found that using mobile and network technologies in the art classroom that centers embodied pedagogy helps students awaken to their environment and allows them to observe, sense, reflect and make art in a renewed way. The mobilization of the body challenges the typical art-making process experienced in a class by promoting risk-taking and increasing spontaneous multimodal digital compositions. The continuous virtual co-presence that characterizes teenagers’ hyper-connectedness contributes to an art experience that connects them to the personal universe of their peers. Each student defines the boundaries of their intimacy and chooses what they wish to share. This type of intervention brings visual art education in secondary schools closer to contemporary art practices that are as much process-oriented as production-oriented.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Landscape as Method and Model: Developing Research-Creation in
Community Through Landscape Painting and Pedagogy in Montréal’s Sud Ouest</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>LeRue, David</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation takes up landscape theory, community-engaged art education, and research-creation methodologies to ask how the creation of artworks can reveal insights into the social, political, and economic foundations of place, and how community artmaking can be used as inductive research to document experienced changes in place over time. This thesis conducts two concurrent projects that focused on Montréal’s Sud Ouest borough, the site of substantial re-development over the past 50 years. The first is a personal research-creation project using plein air landscape painting to theorize painting as fieldwork and research creation. The second was an eight-week community art class called Landscaping the City, which used community-based research creation methodology to conjoin participant artmaking with longform interviews. 17 participant-students engaged in a curriculum focused on the neighborhood’s past, present, and future, balancing skill building with conceptual concerns. To carry out these projects, I embedded in a small community art school and a grassroots anarchist development project which gave insight to how community members have self-organized to meet citizen needs. By thinking these projects together, this thesis theorizes how multimodal engagement with the built environment can help to democratize forms of engagement, make visible contradictory demands and desires for space, and foster civic interest and participation in processes of placemaking.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Healing Through Ancestral Skin Marking:
Traditional Tattooing as Healing and (Re)connection for Indigenous People, with a Focus on Indigenous 2SLGBTQIA+ and Indigenous Women</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lefebvre, Melanie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation, grounded in Michif and Nehiyaw Plains Indigenous worldviews, explores ancestral skin marking or traditional tattooing as a mode of healing and (re)connection for contemporary Indigenous people with a particular focus on 2SLGBTQIA+ and Indigenous women. Traditional tattooing by Indigenous cultures in so-called Canada was deemed savage by explorers, missionaries, and government, with many communities concealing the practice for fear of reprisals by the church and state. This dissertation discusses a new generation of Indigenous traditional tattoo practitioners that is reawakening this practice. It draws on research-creation conducted while traveling through so-called Canada from 2019 to 2024 and engaging with community members through tattoo practice to describe the development of a new Michif and Nehiyaw tattooing methodology. This methodology is born out of the transformative connections made during those travels and grounded in and guided by Michif and Nehiyaw ways of being. These include the relational methodologies of kiyôkêwin (visiting), wâhkôhtowin (kinship), kitimahkinawow (pity and compassion), and tâpwêwin (truth telling) guiding the development of the new Michif and Nehiyaw methodology: O and ∆. These shapes carry and enact meanings related to gender, identity, belonging, transformation, healing, and connecting to ancestral frequencies. Engaging with these methodologies helps us understand, embody, and practice traditional tattooing as ancestral medicine in support of Indigenous people as we imagine and cultivate bold Indigenous futures.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Automated Penetration Testing for Active Distribution Networks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Li, Yuanliang</etd_ms:creator>

        <etd_ms:description>The smart grid is a highly complex cyber-physical system of heterogeneous components with sensory, control, computation, and communication. Due to its complexity, dimensionality, uncertainty, and strong cyber-physical coupling, manually identifying critical vulnerabilities against cyberattacks at infrastructure levels has proven to be challenging. In the information and communication technology (ICT) industry, penetration testing (PT) has demonstrated its efficacy in pinpointing vulnerabilities within information systems through authorized cyberattacks. Building upon the principles of PT, this study delves into exploring effective and efficient PT approaches to discover vulnerabilities for active distribution networks (ADNs) of smart grids based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods.

To overcome the poor efficiency and non-comprehensiveness of common PT in identifying vulnerabilities for an ADN caused by its complex structure and strong cyber-physical coupling, we first propose a DRL-based PT framework and formulate the PT as a Markov decision process (MDP) specifically for the industrial control networks of the ADN. This framework comprehensively considers cyber-physical coupling, realistic cyberattacks, and the physical impacts of ADNs. The framework is applied to model a replay attack scheme on an ADN as the study case, which aims to identify critical attack paths that lead to system voltage violations. Additionally, a co-simulation platform named GridBattleSim was developed specifically for DRL-based PT on ADNs, integrating dedicated simulators for different parts of the ADN. The simulation results show the efficacy of DRL-based PT in learning optimal attack paths under varying system conditions and different levels of attack difficulty.

To overcome the limited observability in practical PT scenarios, a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) formulation is proposed, which allows the PT agent to learn PT policies under partially observable conditions. To solve the POMDP and obtain the optimal PT policy, we apply the physical model of the ADN to estimate its full state based on the local observable data captured by the PT agent and then transform the POMDP to an MDP that can be solved by DRL. 

Furthermore, to address the sparse reward issue, improve the generalization of reward functions, and improve the interpretability of DRL-based PT, a knowledge-informed AutoPT framework (RM-PT) is proposed, which incorporates cybersecurity domain knowledge based on Reward Machine (RM). We use the lateral movement of PT on ANDs as a case study, where two RMs are designed based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK knowledge base as two PT guidelines. Finally, the deep Q-learning with RM (DQRM) algorithm is applied to train the PT policies. The proposed RM-PT is evaluated under the CyberBattleSim platform. The experimental results show that the knowledge-informed PT exhibits a higher training efficiency compared to the PT without knowledge embedding. Furthermore, RMs that incorporate more detailed domain knowledge exhibit superior PT performance compared to RMs with simpler knowledge. 

Finally, we also discuss the future directions of this study in terms of domain knowledge integration for AI-powered PT. We anticipate that the methodologies and findings presented in this study can inspire efforts in securing critical infrastructure and closing research gaps for the cybersecurity of smart grids.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Being, Belonging, and Becoming at Youth-Led Cooperatives in Mexico</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Licon Cisneros, Bertha Erika</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This doctoral thesis explores the motivations and transformative impacts of youth-led cooperatives within Mexico's solidarity economy. The research investigates the motivations behind young entrepreneurs' decisions to form cooperatives and their impact on their personal and collective growth. It delves into how these cooperatives address their emotional, social, financial, and political needs, as well as the dynamics of youth-adult partnerships (Y-APs) that support these ventures.

The research draws from interdisciplinary fields such as positive youth development, community youth development, entrepreneurship, education, and solidarity economy. In this thesis, the solidarity economy is defined based on the principles of equity, solidarity, participatory democracy, sustainability, and pluralism. Methodologically, the thesis employs decolonial and indigenous approaches through a combination of biographical narratives and theoretical insights, ensuring that research collaborators' voices and experiences are central to the analysis. This approach fosters genuine relationality and accountability, providing a platform for participants' authentic perspectives.

Key findings reveal that youth cooperatives provide spaces for positive development, allowing young people to satisfy their social, emotional, economic, and political needs. Within cooperatives, youth experience a sense of being, belonging, and becoming. They foster their self-identity (being), develop a sense of community and inclusion (belonging), and acquire new competencies and skills that prepare them for adulthood (becoming). The study also underscores the critical role of adults as partners in supporting the creation and management of these cooperatives, highlighting the importance of intergenerational collaboration. 

By integrating educational insights and personal and work experiences, my research outlines how the formation of cooperatives is a response to seeking alternatives to the capitalist system.

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring speech expectations during the hiring process and perceived accent discrimination in the workplace: Outcomes for L2 French job applicants and employees in Québec</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>Speech expectations, expectation violation theory, perceived accent discrimination, accent bias, job interview, L2 French, Quebec</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Because people often infer a person’s personal and professional characteristics such as intelligence and competence from that person’s accent, employers, colleagues, or customers may react negatively toward speakers who display second language (L2) speech, which can be detrimental to those speakers’ chances of obtaining a job, their prospects of job advancement, and their sense of belonging to their workplace community. However, the majority of research on accent bias in the workplace focuses on L2 English accents and relies on first-impression listener judgments. This dissertation addresses these shortcomings by providing a comprehensive listener- and speaker-focused perspective through two complementary studies that explore how L2 French speakers are evaluated during extended job interviews and how L2 French speakers experience workplace accent discrimination in Québec.
   Study 1 explored whether L1 French listeners’ evaluations of L1 and L2 French-speaking job applicants would differ under various expectation conditions (congruent, incongruent, no-expectancy). A typical interview process was emulated by presenting 55 HR-experienced listeners first with job applicants’ resumes, then with audio-recorded interview excerpts, which captured how employability evaluations and speech perception might evolve dynamically throughout the interview process. The L2 applicants were perceived as less employable than the L1 applicants. When an applicant was presumed to be an L2 speaker based on her resume, her employability was subsequently upgraded when she spoke L1 French. Lower employability evaluations of L2 applicants were related to their accent being perceived as less prestigious and more difficult to understand than expected.
   Study 2 investigated perceived accent discrimination and its possible consequences from the perspective of 60 L2 French-speaking employees. Participants provided anecdotes and responded to surveys about how they are treated at work due to their French accent and how willing they are to engage in certain work interactions. Having more frequent experiences with accent discrimination in the workplace was associated with employees avoiding taking on leadership roles, participating at meetings, and applying to certain jobs. Common stereotypes mentioned by employees were being labeled as foreigners, perceived as incompetent and unwilling to learn French, and identified as a threat to the survival of French in Québec.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Visual-Infrared Aerial Image Based Wildfire Intelligent Perception</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>Deep Learning; image processing; wildfire perception; wildfire fighting</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This work focuses on the increasingly serious and urgent environmental problem of
wildfire, studying and testing the possible schemes, strategies and solutions in real
application of autonomous wildfire perception and fighting.
To efficiently tackle the wildfire fighting challenges of early detection and fast response
with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), several intelligent computer vision algorithms are
studied, updated, and fine-tuned in this work. These algorithms are designed to work in
conjunction with UAV motion planning and path planning algorithms to detect (early)
wildfire spots based on aerial images, estimate the distance between wildfire spots and
UAV(s), geographically locate these wildfire spots and efficiently approach these spots for
firefighting.
The main contribution of this work is the design of an intelligent wildfire perception
system which utilizes both visible and infrared (VI) aerial image information, integrates
deep-learning (DL) filters for oriented features from accelerated segment test (FAST) and
rotated binary robust independent elementary features (ORB features) to geo-positioning
these wildfire spots. This work proposes a novel concept of combining DL models and ORB
based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technologies as UAV applications in
vision-based wildfire detection, estimation, and geo-positioning and management/fighting.
There are three main functional aspects of the visual-infrared image based intelligent
wildfire perception system in this work.
The first main aspect is wildfire detection, which includes wildfire image classification,
wildfire semantic segmentation, and wildfire spot(s) detection (object detection). For
wildfire image classification, an optimized ResNet-based neural network model is utilized to
achieve higher classification accuracy. For wildfire semantic segmentation, this work focuses
on the U-shaped deep network models (UNets) and proposes the application of original
UNet, an attention gate-enhanced UNet, and a SqueezeNet lightweight attention gate UNet
for early wildfire smoke and flame segmentation. For online wildfire object detection, the
model of you only look once version 5 (YOLOv5) and updated model of you only look
once version 8 (YOLOv8) are utilized to obtain accurate bounding boxes of wildfire spots,
YOLOv8 model can avoid pre-anchors and straightforwardly detect and track the center of
wildfire spots.
The second main aspect is the work of achieving UAV-wildfire distance estimation and
wildfire geo-positioning through monocular ORB-SLAM technology (SLAM2 and SLAM3).
This aspect has two main designs: The first one designs an attention gate UNet to filter ORB
feature points for wildfire distance estimation, achieves more robust results and detailed segmentation at the edges of wildfire smoke and flame spots. This design can be deployed
on ground workstations for detailed missions. The other one designs YOLOv8 filtering
ORB-SLAM3 features for online wildfire distance estimation and geo-positioning, which
can be deployed on the onboard computers for real-time wildfire spot recognition and geopositioning.
This lightweight and fast-responding application can combine with UAV path
and motion planning for online firefighting.
The third aspect comprises several smaller functions to achieve the wildfire perception
system integration. Most of these functions use the infrared information, because the
energy radiation information could support the deep learning wildfire detection to have
more confident and robust detection results. A geometry-based visible and infrared image
alignment and registration scheme is designed in this work. The image registration work
is the basis of the visible and infrared image fusion. Infrared images can also be used to
estimate wildfire spot temperature to guide the safe flight of UAVs. After that, there is a
design of online water retardant release mechanism, and it is briefly discribed.</etd_ms:description>

using Droplet Microfluidics</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Little, Samuel</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Inserting foreign biomolecules into human cells is at the heart of cell engineering protocols. By taking nucleic acids or fully formed proteins and shuttling them across the cell membrane in a 
process known as transfection, cells can either temporarily or permanently gain or lose functionalities. This capability has been used extensively for applications including fundamental 
research into genetics, industrial production of high value biomolecules, and of interest to this thesis, the production of novel cell therapies – where human cells are repurposed to fight disease. 
Numerous techniques have been developed to perform transfection on human cells with a specific focus on technologies that can engineer enough cells for clinical use (often &gt; 10^9 cells are needed to treat a single patient). However, a currently unmet need in this field is a miniaturized platform for the research and development of new cell therapies. For this application, large 
libraries of cellular modifications need to be tested in hopes of discovering one with clinical potential. To do this economically, testing each modification in the library must be done rapidly 
while consuming as few resources as possible. Bulk microfluidics has emerged as an ideal technology for high throughput clinical cell therapy production; however, it is unsuited to processing numerous unique small-scale reactions in parallel. To address the unmet need, in this thesis we demonstrate that droplet microfluidics – the science of controllably manipulating sub-microliter volumes of liquid – can serve as the ideal platform for cell therapy R&amp;D.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Understanding and Locating Quality Issues in the Database Access Code of Database-Backed Applications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Liu, Wei</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Database-backed applications interact with the database management system (DBMS), such as MySQL, for persistent data storage. These database accesses play a central role in such applications and are crucial for their maintenance and quality. Developers build database-backed applications to access relational databases using object-oriented programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, PHP, and C++. Since object-oriented programming is a different paradigm compared to relational databases, developers use various technologies to ease database access by abstracting persistent data as objects. Specifically, developers often rely on two main access technologies: (i) executing a Structured Query Language (SQL) query and manually converting the results to objects; and (ii) using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, which automatically generate SQL queries and convert the results to objects based on various object-database mapping configurations. However, developers may face different database access challenges when using different technologies. Moreover, due to the abstraction of ORM frameworks, developers may face challenges when debugging database access problems. ORM automatically generates SQL queries based on various ORM configurations (e.g., the relationship among object types) and the invoked ORM APIs. As a result, developers do not have direct control over how ORM generates SQL queries. If there is a database access issue associated with a problematic-generated SQL query, developers may have difficulties knowing how and where the SQL query is generated in the application code, causing challenges in debugging database access problems.

Motivated by the importance and challenges of database access, in this thesis, we first conduct an empirical study of database access bugs in seven large-scale Java open-source applications that use relational database management systems. Specifically, by manually examining the bug reports and commit histories ranging from 5 to 16 years, we investigate and derive the characteristics such as categories, root cause, impact, and occurrence of database access issues when using popular database access technologies. Our empirical study provides motivations and guidelines for future research to help avoid, detect, and test database access bugs in database-backed applications. To assist developers in debugging database access problems, we propose an approach for locating the origin (i.e., the control flow path containing a sequence of method calls) that generates a given SQL query. It achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy and improves Top@5 accuracy by 225% and 333% compared to the baseline approach when using SQL session logs and individual query logs, respectively. We also find that our approach can help developers locate data access issues that generate problematic SQL queries (i.e., slow SQL queries and database deadlocks). In conclusion, this thesis uncovers the root causes of database access issues and demonstrates that leveraging both static analysis and information retrieval techniques can help developers debug database access issues associated with problematic SQL queries. It also paves the way for future research on the development and automatic generation of tests for database access code to improve the quality of database-backed applications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exact Algorithms for Network Fortification and Design Problems under Stochastic Interdiction</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mahmoudzadeh Vaziri, Shabnam</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Networks such as telecommunication, transportation, and logistics play a vital role in sustaining social, economic, and industrial operations. However, networks are at risk of natural and man-made disruptions. With the increasing interconnectivity of networks, a disruption in one network can negatively affect other networks. We use network interdiction models to analyze the effects of disruptions on the networks. Interdiction models represent a two-player sequential game between the interdictor, seeking to maximize damage, and the network operator, striving to optimize operations after interdiction. Network interdiction models identify the critical nodes and/or arcs of the network and can be extended to fortify the existing networks or design resilient networks. In this thesis, we study the design of distribution and multicommodity networks and the fortification of spanning trees under stochastic interdictions.

The first paper investigates the distribution network design problem considering the effect of interdictions. Since interdiction outcomes can be uncertain in the real world, we consider the interdiction outcome as an uncertain parameter. We extend the model to consider the correlated facility interdictions where interruptions at one facility affect the nearby facilities. We Benders decomposition algorithm. Improved by two acceleration techniques to solve the model. 

In the second paper, we focus on the design of a multicommodity network with interdictions. The designer does not have information about the interdiction resources; therefore, we consider the uncertainty in the number of interdictions by presenting a tri-level stochastic mathematical model. We present a branch-and-Benders-cut (BBC) algorithm enhanced by several acceleration techniques to solve the model. 

In the third paper, we study the fortification of minimum spanning tree (MST) and optimum communication spanning tree (OCST) problems under stochastic number of interdictions. The MST aims to connect all nodes in a graph with minimal installation cost while satisfying communication requirements with minimum communication cost. The goal is to find the optimal fortification strategy so that the increase in the MST/OCST costs due to the interdiction of unfortified edges is minimized by presenting a tri-level stochastic model. We use backward sampling framework with acceleration technique to solve the deterministic and stochastic MST/OCST fortification problems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Reinforced masonry shear walls with boundary elements (RMSW+BEs) have emerged as a reliable seismic force-resisting system (SFRS) under the Canadian Standards for the Design of Masonry Structures (CSA S304-14) and the National Building Code of Canada for 2015 (NBCC 2015). While reinforced concrete (RC) core walls are commonly used as an SFRS in RC structures due to their ability to allocate staircases and elevators conveniently. The reinforced masonry core walls with boundary elements (RMCW+BEs) remain underexplored in seismic performance studies. The conservative shear strength calculations in CSA S304-14 limit the height of RM ductile shear walls as specified by NBCC, highlighting the need for further research into RM shear strength with varying design parameters.
This research is divided into two phases. Phase I, titled "Seismic Performance Evaluation of the System-level Response of RMCW+BEs," introduces the Applied Element Method (AEM) as a modeling technique to capture the cyclic behavior of fully grouted RM shear walls and the dynamic response of RM buildings. A new structural layout for RM buildings is proposed, with RMCW+BEs as the primary SFRS. The phase evaluates the seismic response of RMCW+BEs designed per CSA S304-14 provisions and examines the effect of higher modes of vibration on seismic performance of RM structures. The ductility and overstrength of the proposed system are quantified using nonlinear pushover analysis following FEMA P695 guidelines, and incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is used to assess seismic collapse risk and to develop system-level-based fragility curves.
Phase II, titled "Experimental Investigation of the Component-Level Response of RMCW+BEs," includes diagonal tension tests on 41 masonry assemblages to evaluate the impact of different vertical and horizontal reinforcement ratios on RM shear strength. A quasi-static cyclic test on a C-shaped RMCW+BEs was conducted to simulate the first story response of a 12-story prototype building’s core wall.
The research demonstrates enhanced performance of RMCW+BEs under design-level earthquakes, meeting the ductility, overstrength, and deformation capacity requirements for a ductile SFRS. The findings support the adoption of RMCW+BEs as an effective SFRS in future North American masonry design standards.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Ghost in the Cell: Phonological Primes as Neural Symbols</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mandal, Sayantan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation investigates the role of abstractions in linguistic knowledge, particularly focusing on phonological representations and its interface with phonetics. It explores how abstract phonological grammar, which determines the "sound patterns" of languages, impacts speech detection, processing, and production. The work consists of a collection of independent articles, with some written specifically for this dissertation, centered on understanding the phonology-phonetics interface from a substance-free perspective.

Chapter 1 sets the historical context for substance-free phonology, tracing its development from the cognitive revolution of the 1950s and the influence of Noam Chomsky's work, culminating in the biolinguistic program.

Chapter 2 reviews the foundations of substance-free phonology, arguing that its philosophical basis stems from the strong-minimalist thesis and emphasizes reducing phonological content in Universal Grammar (UG). It lays the groundwork for constructing a model of the phonology-phonetics interface, emphasizing a partially veridical relationship between phonological form and phonetic substance.

Chapter 3 examines the implications of a substance-free approach for the phonology-phonetics interface, discussing the challenges of a deterministic relationship between phonological form and phonetic realization. It proposes a hybrid framework that avoids both absolute determinism and complete arbitrariness, supported by neurobiological models of speech processing.

Chapter 4 presents an empirical study using dichotic listening to investigate how bilinguals manage phonological features in speech perception. The study finds that perceptual intrusions from an unattended language are influenced by voicing, supporting a feature specification approach based on privative features and underspecification.

Chapter 5 continues the behavioral investigation with experiments on velar palatalization in Malayalam. It reports significant vowel and suffix effects on palatalization, contributing to understanding the phonological and phonetic division of labor. An interface account, couched in the hybrid framework developed in Chapter 3, is provided.

Chapter 6 discusses neurobiological research on phonological representations, including a project examining event-related potentials (ERP) to differentiate phonological from other linguistic alternations. It also proposes future research on contrasting phonological and phonetic alternations in Hindi and French.

Chapter 7 concludes by reflecting on the dissertation's contributions, emphasizing the unifying theme of abstract substance-free neural symbols in phonological representations, and addressing feedback received throughout the research.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis aims to identify the main methodological questions around Rapid Reviews (RRs) methods and undertake methodological studies to explore the impact of time-saving methods on review results. Study 1: An eDelphi study and consensus meeting were conducted, involving experts and evidence synthesis knowledge users. From an initial list, participants rated (low, medium or high importance) and ranked each item’s importance to improve the time-efficiency of RRs. Items rated as high by ≥75% of participants progressed to the next round, and the final list was concluded during the consensus meeting. Study 2: This methodological study used Cochrane cardiac rehabilitation reviews to assess how database selection impacts study inclusion and outcomes. By examining where each included study was indexed and re-running meta-analyses, we evaluated whether treatment effects varied based on different database combinations. Study 3: This methodological study compared single-review and peer-review (two independent reviewers with a third for discrepancies) approaches for screening titles and abstracts. We assessed the percentage of missed studies, sensitivity, specificity, time, and costs for each method. Results: Study 1 identified seven highly important methodological questions. Three items on search strategy, two on study selection, one on quality/bias assessment, and one on data extraction. Study 2 found that Embase plus CENTRAL was the best database combination. When considering the estimated effects on mortality, when combining the major databases in pairs (MEDLINE, Embase, or CENTRAL), only 38% of results were identical to all databases combined. This percentage increased to 66% when combining three databases. Study 3 found that a single review approach missed 4% of inclusions (sensitivity was 0.84, and specificity was 0.86) and took half the time and costs of peer-review study selections. Conclusion: Search strategy is an important methodological question and based on our results, using at least three databases is recommended for a meta-analysis, but one large database may suffice depending on the review context. Regarding study selection, a single review approach can be useful when time is short. This thesis sets a research agenda to optimise RRs and has the potential to influence global literature, establish best practices, and offer replicable methods for researchers.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>We study the Renting Servers in the Cloud problem (\RSiC), which addresses the need for efficient job allocation in cloud computing applications. Jobs arrive in an online manner and need to be assigned to servers. The size of each job is known at the time of arrival. If the duration of the jobs is also known, the scenario is termed clairvoyant; if the duration is unknown, it is non-clairvoyant. An infinite supply of identical servers is available, each providing one unit of computational capacity per unit of time across all dimensions. A server can be rented at any time and remains rented until all assigned jobs are completed. The cost of an assignment is the sum of the rental periods of all servers. The objective is to allocate jobs to servers in a way that minimizes the overall cost while adhering to server capacity constraints.

We first focus on a scenario where all jobs have equal durations and analyze the performance of two natural algorithms, \NF and \FF. We establish a tight bound of $2$ on the competitive ratio of \NF. For \FF, we also prove bounds under several restrictions. Next, we conduct a parameterized analysis of \FF, examining inputs where it utilizes at most $k$ servers simultaneously. We support the theoretical analysis with extensive experimental studies. Then, we show for a large class of well-known algorithms for  \RSiC, none of them always outperforms the others. 
We study the multi-dimensional \RSiC setting, where jobs/servers have multi-parameter resource demands/capacities (e.g., cores, memory). We demonstrate a direct sum property of \RSiC. We also propose a novel clairvoyant algorithm called \Greedy; our experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing algorithms in most scenarios. We introduce and analyze performance of a new sub-family of \AF algorithms termed monotone \AF, which includes \Greedy, \FF, \LF, and \MTFtext. 
Finally we  evaluate both clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant algorithms for \RSiC on real-world data using the Azure dataset. The results are sometimes different from those previously obtained on synthetic data. We also proposed some new algorithms that are combinations of known algorithms and outperform all existing algorithms in our experiments.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring the Luminescence Dynamics of Lanthanide-Doped Nanoparticles: Exploiting the Temporal Dimension for Diverse Applications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Maurizio, Steven</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Lanthanide luminescence at the nanoscale has garnered considerable attention over the last few decades, with research on ternary fluoride nanoparticles focusing heavily on upconversion and to a lesser extent on radioluminescence. However, these nanomaterials have not yet been implemented commercially. This is likely, in part, due to the overwhelming emphasis on demonstrating potential applications, rather than understanding the fundamental mechanisms that drive these luminescence phenomena. As a result, the forbidden nature of the lanthanide 4f-4f transitions has hindered the widespread implementation of such nanoparticles.
To shed light on the complex nature of lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles, studies on co-doped Yb3+ and Tm3+ nanoparticles were completed with varying host composition (including LiYF4, NaGdF4, and BaYF5) and activator dopant concentration (ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mol%). The interionic spacing and site symmetry of the lanthanide ions was deemed to play an integral role in the relative intensity of each Tm3+ emission, indicating that different combinations are optimal for different applications. With the addition of an active shell doped with Tb3+, the energy transfer across the core/shell interface was evaluated next, establishing that a radiative energy transfer mechanism from the 1D2 excited state of Tm3+ was most prominent.
Influences known to affect the upconversion efficiency of nanomaterials were then evaluated on LiLuF4:Eu3+ radioluminescent nanoparticles. The results herein indicated that a greater material density and effective atomic number improved the efficiency of the radioluminescence process, while varying the dopant concentration was not as influential, when compared to direct ultraviolet excitation. Furthermore, the addition of Gd3+ as a sensitizer or employing core/shell structures did not prove advantageous to the radioluminescence intensity.
While luminescence lifetimes are measured to evaluate nonradiative energy transfer efficiencies between spectroscopically active species, proof-of-concepts herein demonstrate that they can also be employed to add a temporal component to various applications. These include upconversion nanothermometry, particle velocimetry, and covert information storage, all taking advantage of the long-lived excited state decay times of various lanthanide ions.</etd_ms:description>

Virtual Islands, Submersion, Empathy, and Identity in Virtual Reality

Olivia Mc Gilchrist, Ph.D.
Concordia University, 2024

This project explores the novel possibilities of representation offered by VR, and the tension between the promise of VR-as-empathy-machine and VR as another form of media relying on limitation or stereotype. As an artist-researcher, I engage with various Black thinkers and artists to reimagine how my iterative research-creation artwork can foster constructive dialogue around the re-inscription of Blackness and whiteness within immersive installations and VR worlds. With VR’s potential omnipresence in mind, the thesis’ theoretical component advocates for an approach to VR that builds on concepts and practices proposed by established theorists and working artists across the realm of contemporary art and popular culture, in regard to Black representation, feminist representation, and submersion - water as a historical space - through the lens of Black futurity and Caribbean hybridity within a postcolonial context. My positionality as a French Jamaican, visibly white and of non-visible mixed heritage, informs this project’s artistic component. My artwork initially sought to interpret these theoretical lessons by designing a VR experience where Black and white subjects are represented in relation through performance. Moreover, these same thinkers and artists led me to continue interrogating how a white-passing artist can create VR art that is able to address issues of race and gender, and that transcends their white privilege. By shifting my approach to focus on the experiential aspects of submersion, I propose a call toward a mode of inclusive, collaborative VR creation, exploring the technology’s potential while remaining watchful when undertaking the portrayal and enactment of distinct identities through VR mediums.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Essays on Human Capital Management Disclosure</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Melhem, Cynthia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation consists of two essays on the newly mandated Human Capital Management (HCM) disclosure introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. The SEC adopts a principles-based approach, allowing firms discretion over what to disclose, resulting in significant variation in HCM disclosures. The first essay investigates the role of board Human Resources (HR) governance on HCM disclosure transparency. More companies are renaming their compensation committees as HR committees to reflect a broader responsibility for HCM, and more companies are appointing directors with HR expertise. The results show that board HR governance is positively associated with HCM disclosure transparency, but only when both an HR committee and HR expertise are present. Conversely, when either mechanism exists in isolation, HCM disclosure transparency is lower. These findings suggest that both mechanisms are necessary to promote effective HCM transparency. The results are more pronounced in firms with a Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and firms experiencing employment growth. These findings hold true when using an entropy-balanced sample. The second essay examines the usefulness of HCM disclosure transparency to financial analysts, who play a key role in capital markets. The results show that HCM transparency is associated with higher analyst forecast accuracy but has no significant association with forecast dispersion. This suggests that HCM transparency adds to individual analysts' private information, helping them assess firm value from HCM practices. Furthermore, the second essay identifies which HCM topics are most relevant to analysts. The results reveal that topics related to attraction, retention, development, turnover, compensation and benefits, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and culture are associated with higher forecast accuracy, particularly when the numerical intensity of these topics is higher. This suggests that not all HCM topics are equally informative, with a clear emphasis on quantitative details that provide analysts with the information needed to evaluate firm value effectively.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The expansion of neoliberal globalization has influenced the marketization of education and led the charge to shape competency-based educational policies. In Québec, Canada, public school curricula have mandated competency-based education (CBE) to address and remedy student retention rates and employability concerns. While the stated goal proposed by reform policies for instituting CBE is to eliminate social and economic inequities, teachers are concerned that it may exacerbate inequality gaps among our most vulnerable populations. A critical ethnographic methodology was employed to structure and analyze individual interview narratives of ten CÉGEP college teachers, using critical theory and critical pedagogy as philosophical underpinnings. Additionally, I examined the neoliberal marketization of education to shed some light on the conditions that influence CBE practices. 

The results indicated that the conditions under which CBE persists alienate college teachers from their work and perpetuate educational, structural, and societal inequalities. Teachers’ feedback discloses that the excessive focus on CBE and the execution of its practices does not align with their beliefs of the experience education should offer students. The findings revealed disproportionate marginalizing of teachers’ voices and participation in decision-making and workplace changes due to inequalities generated by neoliberal hierarchical connections. Consequently, my research shifted teachers’ roles from reform implementers to allowing them to participate in interview dialogues about educational changes. Teachers’ voices illustrate that such collaborative initiatives could result in educational progress, equitable changes, and positive effects on professional development. These findings support the notion that more intentional collaboration among educators is critical to re-address power inequalities, eradicate undemocratic neoliberal practices and sustain educational reform. It also suggests that teachers’ involvement in critical discourse could be leveraged to work toward positive educational change. Given that little research has conducted an in-depth analysis of teachers’ views and experiences in fulfilling CBE mandates, my thesis offers insights into how teachers can deliberate and mobilize their responses to address and challenge unilateral neoliberal competency-based reforms.

        <etd_ms:title>Enhancing Conflict Resolution in the TRIZ Method Using ATDM</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mohammadi, Ali</etd_ms:creator>

        <etd_ms:description>The significance of innovation in enhancing and strengthening businesses and industries is increasingly evident in today’s competitive market. A key area within design science involves the study and development of creative design methodologies that assist designers in structuring creative processes and systematically addressing design problems.
Among the various design methodologies proposed, TRIZ, developed by Genrich Altshuller in Russia in 1956, stands out as one of the most influential.  TRIZ focuses on defining a design problem, extracting the inherent conflicts (contradictions), and employing specific tools to systematically generate solutions.
In recent decades, extensive research has been conducted on TRIZ, predominantly employing an inductive approach. Researchers have typically designed experiments and case studies to analyze and refine TRIZ. While this approach has its merits, it requires substantial resources and time for execution and analysis, and the conclusions drawn are often confined to the specific contexts of those experiments. In contrast, this thesis adopts a deductive approach to study, analyze, and enhance TRIZ. Rather than focusing on the design of experiments and tests, we concentrate on axioms, proofs, and principles, utilizing logic and reasoning to analyze TRIZ and draw conclusions regarding its mechanism for resolving design conflicts.  This unique approach not only advances TRIZ as a creative design methodology but also presents a systematic strategy that could potentially be applied to the development of other design methodologies.
In this thesis, we pursued three main objectives. Firstly, we analyzed TRIZ through a deductive framework known as the TASKS framework to explore how it can foster a creative environment for designers. Our analysis identified the key barriers and enablers of TRIZ that influence designers during the design process. This examination of TRIZ's limitations and weaknesses raises an important question: how can we scientifically and systematically enhance a creative design methodology like TRIZ? Therefore, the second objective of this study was to propose a deductive method grounded in the Axiomatic Theory of Design Modeling (ATDM), aimed at systematically improving creative design methodologies such as TRIZ. Employing this method could save design researchers both time and resources in analyzing creative design methodologies and developing strategies for their advancement. Through the application of this proposed method, we clarified how TRIZ could be further developed.
Finally, the third objective of this thesis was to introduce and evaluate a new iteration of TRIZ that integrates Environment Based Design (EBD) and utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs). As part of this contribution, we leveraged LLMs to introduce a conceptual design chatbot based on TRIZ and EBD. In this model, the designer inputs a design problem, and the chatbot generates systematic questions following the principles of EBD. The designer and the LLM then respond to these questions. The chatbot processes the answers according to EBD principles, which are subsequently used to perform functional analysis. Ultimately, a conflict (or contradiction) is identified within the functional analysis, and the LLM employs TRIZ principles to generate solutions and suggest a team of experts to execute the project. The evaluation of this LLM-based conceptual design chatbot demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing design problems and generating accurate and comprehensive outputs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In next-generation wireless communication systems, such as 5G and beyond, channel estimation plays a vital role in ensuring robust and high-performance communication. Given the increasing complexity of wireless environments—characterized by high mobility, massive antenna arrays, and rapidly changing channels—accurate channel estimation is crucial for tasks such as beamforming, spatial multiplexing, interference management, signal detection, and equalization. This thesis focuses on developing novel algorithms for estimating doubly selective channels in MIMO systems and is divided into three parts.

The first part introduces three compressive sensing (CS)-based algorithms for channel estimation in millimeter wave (mmWave) hybrid MIMO systems. These algorithms utilize the basis expansion model (BEM) to efficiently capture the channel’s time variations while significantly reducing the number of unknown channel parameters. The first algorithm is adaptable to various training sequence structures, offering flexibility, while the second and third algorithms use specialized training sequences to reduce computational complexity. 

The second part shifts focus to MIMO OTFS systems, recognized for their robustness against Doppler effects and delay spreads. A new row-block sparse formulation is introduced for channel estimation in the delay-Doppler domain, allowing for efficient handling of the MIMO channel matrix by grouping non-zero entries into row blocks. A row-block OMP (RBOMP) algorithm is then applied, enhancing both the accuracy and computational efficiency of the estimation process.

The final part presents another novel doubly selective channel estimation scheme for MIMO OTFS systems, leveraging a two-dimensional discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (2D DPS-BEM). This model provides a more efficient representation of the MIMO channel in the delay-Doppler domain, reducing the number of unknown parameters needed for estimation. Unlike existing CS-based methods, which require prior knowledge of the number of propagation paths, this method relies only on the channel's maximum Doppler and delay shifts, significantly lowering computational complexity. Additionally, a low-overhead pilot scheme is introduced to capture temporal channel variations more efficiently, further enhancing estimation performance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This study evaluates compact cogeneration technologies for urban areas with varying energy demands, focusing on renewable fuels such as hydrogen and biogas, compared to fossil fuels like methane. Among various options, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells) and recuperated micro-gas turbines (MGTs) are identified as the most promising technologies. Their performance under diverse scenarios, including control strategies, fuel choices, and operational conditions, is thoroughly modeled.
For PEM fuel cells, detailed electrochemical and thermal models simulate electricity and heat production, while for MGTs, a comprehensive model optimizes heat recovery and control strategies. The developed control strategy involves precise bypass valve adjustments to regulate mass flow distribution, improving efficiency. Heat management is further enhanced by coordinating bypass valve settings with storage tank cycles and auxiliary boiler transitions.
PEM fuel cells are shown to excel in high-efficiency cogeneration due to their direct conversion of chemical to electrical energy at low operational temperatures, minimizing heat loss and optimizing hydrogen utilization. MGT systems, on the other hand, benefit from hydrogen combustion’s higher flame temperatures, boosting power generation. Parametric analysis reveals that increasing rotational speed, pressure ratios, and working parameters in MGTs enhances power output, while higher cell counts and ambient temperatures improve PEM fuel cell efficiency and hydrogen consumption.
To reduce emissions from MGTs, a dual axial swirler combustor is proposed, ensuring uniform temperature distribution, minimizing hot spots, and enhancing fuel-air mixing. These features improve combustion efficiency and stability under partial loads, effectively lowering NOX and CO emissions. The emission characteristics are assessed using CFD simulations, an Equivalent Chemical Reactor Network (ECRN) model, and a custom mathematical model. Hydrogen combustion is associated with high NOX emissions due to its flame temperature, while methane and biogas show lower NOX concentrations. However, the inert CO2 in biogas presents challenges for efficiency.
In summary, this research provides a robust framework for evaluating renewable-fueled cogeneration systems, offering strategies to enhance efficiency and reduce emissions, supporting urban energy sustainability.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Framing Extreme Precipitation Events in the Context of Cumulative Emissions</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Heavy to extreme precipitation events are often-destructive forms of weather that, despite their infrequency, can lead to significant losses of human life and infrastructural damage. Such events are expected to increase in a warmer world as cumulative carbon emissions continue to rise. However, the extent to which this increase occurs varies considerably across scenarios and spatial scales, especially for the most extreme precipitation. The Transient Response to Cumulative CO2 Emissions (TCRE) has proven to be a powerful metric that characterizes the linear response of global mean temperature to cumulative carbon emissions, and previous research has shown its potential applicability to other climate indicators, such as regional temperature and precipitation, and heat extremes. By using simulations from nine Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, I intend to quantify extreme precipitation indices of one-day maximum (Rx1day) and five-day maximum (Rx5day) events against cumulative CO2 emissions. I show that the TCRE framework can be applied to represent changes in these precipitation extremes, with validation of this approach at sub-global scales across emissions scenarios. In Chapter 3, I determine whether precipitation extremes respond linearly to cumulative CO2 emissions, at global to local scales, using simple linear regression modelling. In Chapter 4, I conduct a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis to model the behavior of the most extreme values of Rx1day and Rx5day and evaluate whether trends in location parameter estimates and specified return levels can be approximated by (regional) TCRE values. For Chapter 5, I extend this analysis to estimate remaining carbon budgets (RCBs) associated with avoiding particular extreme precipitation levels. Overall, my results suggest that extreme precipitation work well within a TCRE framework, and that global and sub-global changes can be well approximated by linear responses to cumulative CO2 emissions, though with less robustly linear trends at local scales. My results further highlight that location parameter estimates and return levels of Rx1day and Rx5day scale approximately linearly to increasing cumulative carbon emissions. My findings also show that RCBs are generally small to avoid specified present-day 20-year and 100-year return levels. This suggests that such events are becoming commonplace with global warming.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Theory of Strategic Autonomy: U.S. Foreign Policy between 1823 and 1921</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Morneau, Louis-Philippe</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Resistance to the established world order and the dominant codes of conduct by a plurality of international actors is a repeated but misunderstood occurrence in the international system. Challengers to the status quo, ostracized states in the international system, neutrals looking for peaceful pathways to prosperity, and pivotal states unwilling to commit to a side have all searched for alternative strategies to gain power or maintain stability while maintaining autonomy of action. The theory of strategic autonomy proposes an approach to understanding such behaviour. Alliances in the international system are not always a possibility or desirable. Rather than perceiving those states as problems, I propose that they perceive and respond differently to the stimuli of the international system. This thesis looks at how and why the United States spent over a hundred years avoiding the commitment to formal alliances in the international system. The particular path of the U.S. foreign policy between 1823 and 1921 offers a complex and interesting test to the theory of strategic autonomy. While the United States disposed of an advantageous geostrategic position, European powers displayed interest in intermingling in its affairs and sphere of influence. To keep the European powers at arm’s length, the American administrations used a variety of strategies to deter the involvement of the European powers in its sphere of influence and most of all to avoid the necessity of an alliance to do so. Strategic autonomy bears increasing importance in the international system with the diminution of the relative power of the United States and the emergence of new hubs of powers including China and India. To understand how the United States achieved the status of great power without a formal commitment to the alliance system between the European powers before the Second World War is crucial to understand how China, India, or any other emerging power might be able to repeat a feat comparable to the rise of the United States power.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Model-Based Predictive Control Strategies and Renewable Energy Integration for Energy Flexibility Enhancement in School Buildings</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Morovat, Navid</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates methods to enhance the energy flexibility potential of school buildings through simulation and experimental studies. It contributes a general methodology for the development of data driven grey-box thermal models and the implementation of model-based predictive control (MPC). The methodology is applied to an archetype fully electric school building near Montréal, Québec, Canada. This approach is scalable and transferable to other institutional or mid-size commercial buildings.
To streamline the implementation of MPC, the proposed approach employs grey-box low-order resistance-capacitance (RC) thermal network models, a clustering of weather conditions to identify typical anticipated scenarios, and several near-optimal setpoint profiles corresponding to each cluster. Archetype control-oriented models for zones with convective systems and zones with radiant floor systems are developed and calibrated with measured data. The calibrated models are used to apply MPC to the school building using the established dynamic tariffs for morning and evening peaks. For the experimental study, the developed MPC framework is applied in six classrooms, and the results are compared with four classrooms with the reactive control system as reference cases. The energy flexibility is quantified based on a proposed building energy flexibility index (BEFI). Results indicated that the school building can provide 45% to 95% energy flexibility (load shifting relative to reference) during on peak hours while satisfying thermal comfort constraints.
Finally, this thesis presents an MPC methodology for the integration of air-based photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems to further enhance the energy flexibility in school buildings so that in addition to the production of solar electricity, they can be used to preheat fresh air for the classrooms during the heating season. A data-driven grey box model for the classrooms is calibrated with measured data, and a PV/T model as a renewable energy retrofit measure for energy efficiency and flexibility is developed. These models are integrated to apply MPC and reduce peak demand during morning and evening. Results show that using an MPC along with PV/T integration can significantly reduce peak demand during morning and evening high demand periods for the grid. The proposed methodology helps institutional buildings to facilitate their integration into future smart grids and smart cities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Markers of regional subcutaneous adipose tissue (dys)function
in childhood-onset versus adult-onset obesity before and after weight loss</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Murphy, Jessica L.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>People with childhood-onset obesity have greater risk of type 2 diabetes than people with adult-onset obesity. However, we do not understand the mechanisms contributing to this disease risk discrepancy or whether these mechanisms can be reversed. A decline in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) function (i.e., the ability to safely store lipids and regulate adipokine production) is linked to type 2 diabetes and may therefore vary by age of obesity onset. This dissertation aimed to compare markers of regional SAT (dys)function between people with childhood-onset and adult-onset obesity. 

Original article 1 investigated the longstanding yet controversial notion that SAT is hyperplastic (has many small adipocytes) in childhood-onset obesity and hypertrophic (has fewer large adipocytes) in adult-onset obesity. This notion held true only for abdominal SAT in females. The degree of abdominal SAT hypertrophy or hyperplasia was unaffected by age of obesity onset in males. In contrast, femoral SAT was hypertrophic in both males and females with childhood-onset obesity compared to their counterparts with adult-onset obesity. 

Original articles 2 &amp; 3 examined preadipocyte DNA damage (γH2AX), senescence markers (p53 and p21), and SAT immune cell profiles in females with childhood-onset and adult-onset obesity, both before and after moderate (~10%) weight loss. Compared to females with adult-onset obesity, those with childhood-onset obesity had a greater proportion of preadipocytes with DNA damage and senescence markers in abdominal and femoral SAT, but a slightly lower proportion of M1-like ‘pro-inflammatory’ macrophages in abdominal SAT. The proportions of M1-like macrophages in femoral SAT and M2-like ‘anti-inflammatory’ macrophages, CD3+CD4+ T cells, and CD3+CD8+ T cells in abdominal and femoral SAT did not differ between groups. After weight loss, preadipocyte DNA damage declined in both females with childhood-onset and adult-onset obesity. Other changes, however, occurred only in females with adult-onset obesity: the intensity of p21 in p53+p21+ femoral preadipocytes and the proportion of M1-like macrophages in abdominal SAT decreased, while the proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells in abdominal and femoral SAT increased.
 
Recognizing the differences in markers of SAT (dys)function between people with childhood-onset and adult-onset obesity may help guide the development of tailored treatment strategies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Machine Learning-Driven Strategies for Efficient Resource Management in Cloud Data Centers</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mustafa, Daraghmeh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Cloud computing is one of the major paradigms in the information technology industry, offering diverse scalable on-demand services over the Internet. Nevertheless, managing and predicting workloads in cloud data centers is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of cloud services. In order to reduce costs and improve performance while managing cloud resources efficiently, it is essential to obtain highly accurate projections and estimations. Therefore, this thesis proposes a methodological framework that integrates multiple machine learning models to improve estimation accuracy and enable better decision-making within cloud data centers. In terms of clustering, we develop segmentation pipelines that incorporate various clustering techniques with different data preprocessing methods to improve the cloud workload segmentation process. This process aims to reveal hidden patterns within workloads to obtain segmentation based on various data-driven perspectives. In predictive modeling, we delve into the enhancement of prediction precision, focusing on single-output and multi-output forecasting models. For single-output-based prediction, we propose a multilevel learning-based model for resource utilization prediction that leverages anomaly, clustering, and ensemble methods to improve prediction outcomes. Also, we present a proactive regression-based cost estimation approach, navigating the complexities of prediction-based cloud service pricing and the effect of various target transformation methods on prediction accuracy. In addition, we propose a host load prediction, leveraging both imbalance and ensemble learning methods to improve prediction and handle the challenge of the imbalance states within cloud computing systems. For multi-output-based prediction, advanced predictive models are proposed to forecast function invocation patterns at the user, application, and function levels within serverless computing environments. In this thesis, we conducted research that utilizes advanced data analysis techniques, including windowing, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble learning, to enhance the robustness and precision of workload segmentation and predictive models within cloud environments. We evaluated the proposed models based on their efficiency in processing real cloud workloads using various performance metrics. The findings of this thesis hold the potential to revolutionize cloud resource management, leading to more intelligent, adaptable, and cost-effective cloud operations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The deep paraspinal muscles are essential for providing physical support and stability to the spinal column. They play a vital role in maintaining fine postural control of the spine and are responsible for controlling all movements of the vertebral column. These muscles work in coordination to ensure proper alignment and movement of the spine, thereby contributing to overall spinal health and function. Dysfunction or weakness in paraspinal muscles can lead to instability, poor posture, and increased risk of spinal pain disorders. Therefore, understanding the role of deep paraspinal muscles is crucial in maintaining spinal health and preventing musculoskeletal disorders. This summary highlights the significance of assessing both morphology and function of paraspinal muscles in common spinal disorders including chronic low back pain (LBP) and degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). While previous studies have focused on either morphology or functional deficits separately, this dissertation aims to comprehensively investigate the structure-function relationship using advanced imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound. Specifically, chapter three focuses on understanding the relationship between lumbar multifidus muscle (MF) muscle morphology and function in chronic LBP patients, utilizing measures such as fatty infiltration, contraction, stiffness, and elasticity. Similarly, chapter four and five aim to assess cervical muscle morphology as predictors of prognosis and functional recovery in patients with DCM, both pre- and post-operatively. Such comprehensive evaluations are crucial for improving diagnosis, intervention, and therapeutic strategies in spinal disorders, ultimately enhancing patients’ clinical outcomes and quality of life. Finally, chapter six discusses the findings from chapters three, four and five and offers a general conclusion and recommendations for future research.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Lightweight Authentication for Edge Computing</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nakkar, Mouna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Edge computing (EC) is one of the most promising decentralized network paradigms in the proliferation era of the Internet of Things (IoT). Although this paradigm has high potential in terms of performance and de-centralization, it carries several security concerns. One of the most important security properties for the EC paradigm is authenticity. It allows different edge computing entities to verify each other through cryptographic means. Additionally, authenticity regulates access control to different edge computing resources and data. There are several types of authentications, one-way authentication, mutual authentication, broadcast authentication, group authentication, and others. In our thesis, we focus on designing security protocols for different edge computing applications that require either mutual authentication, broadcast authentication, or group authentication. In all our proposed protocols we utilize lightweight security primitives suitable for the three-tier cloud-edge-IoT architecture.
In the first protocol, we utilize lightweight cryptographic primitives to design mutual authentication for EC broadcast messages. Specifically, the used primitives are only hash-based one-way chain, symmetric-key cryptography, and a hash function. The protocol establishes key-agreement for group and individual nodes in each session. The achieved security properties for our protocol are mutual-authentication for broadcast messages, message secrecy, message integrity, and forward secrecy. We formally define and prove the main security properties of our protocol theoretically using the indistinguishability game. We compare our protocol to other lightweight protocols in terms of security and performance to prove its advantages in terms of computations, communication overhead, and storage.
Motivated by the fact that mass authentication is one of the desirable security features in the edge computing paradigm, our second proposed protocol is a lightweight group authentication scheme (GAS) with session key-agreement. The protocol utilizes lightweight cryptographic primitives, namely, Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) scheme and aggregated message authentication code (Aggregated-MAC). Unlike other group authentication schemes, our protocol provides multiple asynchronous authentications. Furthermore, we implement a simple key refreshing mechanism such that in each session, a new session-key between group nodes and the authenticating server is established without the need for redistributing new shares. Our security analysis includes proving that our protocol provides group authenticity, message forward secrecy, and prevents several attacks.
Extending our group authentication design, our third security protocol is a flexible GAS based on Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) and Shamir’s secret sharing scheme. Specifically, we apply PUFs on SSS and utilize the SSS-homomorphic property to achieve multiple-time group authentications with the same set of shares. Our scheme is lightweight, establishes a new group key-agreement per session, and supports efficient node-evicting mechanism. Furthermore, in our protocol, the group nodes do not store any shares; instead, the nodes derive their secret-shares from their PUF-responses. We formally analyze our protocol theoretically and with automated tools, Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Applications (AVISPA), to prove that our scheme achieves message secrecy and authenticity.
Finally, we propose a lightweight symmetric-key based protocol which provides edge-IoT mutual authentication, forward secrecy, backward secrecy, and anonymity. The security primitives used in our fourth protocol are pseudo-random function (PRF), random number generation, a hash function, and xor. We prove the security goals of the protocol and compare it to other lightweight authentication protocols.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Developing UMAC: A Unified Model-Agnostic Computation Process for Enhanced Machine Learning Explainability</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Neghawi, Elie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Deep Learning; Explainable Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Self-Supervised Machine Learning; Semi-Supervised Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Graph Neural Networks</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>The rapid evolution of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has produced increasingly efficient and versatile algorithms, but the factors driving their superior performance remain underexplored. While previous research has primarily focused on explaining Semi-Supervised Machine Learning (SSML) algorithms in a model-specific manner, this thesis aims to generalize those findings, making them applicable across a wider range of CNNs. The challenge lies in achieving a method that can both enhance performance and improve interpretability, while remaining adaptable to various models.

This thesis introduces a post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, called Unified Model Agnostic Computation (UMAC), designed to generalize common components of CNNs by drawing insights from SSML and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) algorithms. Our research begins by focusing on two primary aspects: (1) the effect of parameter updates during training on both labeled and unlabeled data in SSML and SSL, and (2) the transition from model-specific SSML frameworks to a more generalized, model-agnostic approach using SSL.

In the first phase, we used SSML as a foundation, breaking down their components into preprocess-centric and classifier-centric elements, which led to the creation of SSCPs (Semi-Supervised Computation Processes). These processes were tested across five state-of-the-art SSML algorithms and three SSL algorithms, using various  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Although this phase acted as a testing ground to understand the mechanics of SSML, it allowed us to identify key drivers of performance, especially in relation to parameter updates and data handling.

Through 45 rigorous experiments, we observed an 8% reduction in training loss and a 6.75% increase in learning precision using the Shake-Shake26 classifier with the RemixMatch SSML algorithm. A key observation was the positive correlation between labeled data and training time, showcasing the importance of label quantity in enhancing model efficiency.

In the second phase, we transitioned from SSML to SSL to prove that the methodology could be generalized to a model-agnostic approach. By integrating SSL components, we aimed to develop a unified framework that worked across various DNN architectures. Building upon this analysis, we developed a UMAC process for SSL, tailored to complement modern self-supervised learning algorithms. UMAC serves as a model-agnostic XAI methodology that explains models by composition, systematically integrating and enhancing state-of-the-art algorithms. Through UMAC, we identified key computational mechanisms and crafted a unified framework for self-supervised learning evaluation. Our systematic approach yielded a 17.12% improvement in training time complexity and a 13.1% boost in testing time complexity, with notable improvements observed in augmentation, encoder architecture, and auxiliary components within the network classifier. This phase demonstrated that UMAC could enhance accuracy and reduce training loss under different data conditions, showing its adaptability to different models and datasets.

In the third phase, we applied the UMAC framework to the field of medical image classification. Medical imaging tasks often suffer from data scarcity, making it challenging to achieve both high performance and model interpretability. By leveraging the UMAC methodology, we integrated it into CNNs and Transformers to generate high-quality representations, even with limited data. Experiments across five 2D medical image datasets showed that UMAC outperformed traditional augmentation methods by 1.89% in classification accuracy. Additionally, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques ensured that the models provided transparent and reliable decision-making processes, enhancing their interpretability in critical medical applications.

Throughout this process, UMAC served as an XAI method based on explaining models by composition, systematically breaking down computational processes to reveal how model components contribute to overall performance. This approach enabled us to create a unified, model-agnostic framework that enhanced both transparency and efficiency in CNNs.

Ultimately, this thesis contributes a structured and generalizable approach for Machine Learning (ML) developers, offering step-by-step guidelines to improve model performance and interpretability. By generalizing the computation processes of SSML and SSL through the UMAC framework, we provide developers with the tools needed to optimize their models across various domains, particularly in fields where transparency and accuracy are critical.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis consists of three distinct chapters. The first chapter delves into the effects of tuition hikes on students’ choice of majors in the United States. Traditionally, passion, interests, and talents have been the primary factors influencing high school graduates’ decisions when choosing a major in college, without much concern for job prospects or the ability to repay student loans. It may be time to reassess this approach. Since the Great Recession, public universities in the United States have experienced a significant increase in tuition fees, leading to notable shifts in students’ choice of majors. The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields have gained popularity, with the share of STEM degrees awarded rising from 16% in the academic year 2009-10 to 43% in 2015-16, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Conversely, the proportion of degrees awarded in the arts and humanities (ARTS) has significantly declined, with a 5% decrease in 2015 compared to the previous year and nearly a 10% decrease from 2012 (Jaschik ,2017). This decline in humanities and liberal arts degrees poses a significant issue for policymakers and universities in the United States, often leading to the discontinuation of certain programs. Building upon the previous work of Ionescu (2009), who examines the effects of financial aid policies on enrollment decisions and default rates, my research focuses on the costs associated with investing in higher education borne by students and optimal decisions in terms of major choices.
The second chapter of my research focuses on estimating the substitutability between public and private consumption in Canada. Using annual data from Statistics Canada, I estimate a model in which the annual data for government and private consumption from the Canada’s National Statistical Agency is fitted into a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) consumption function. Through cointegration tests and estimation results, I have identified an Edgeworth complementarity between public and private spending in Canada, suggesting that they are interdependent and exhibit a close relationship.
The third chapter analyzes interprovincial migration of skilled workers in Canada. It aims to explain the out-migration of skilled workers in Quebec as skilled workers exodus has a serious impact on the tax revenue and productivity.  Although Quebec attracts students with high ability each year, as it hosts some of the best English-speaking universities in Canada, many of these individuals choose to leave the province after finishing their studies. This exodus is often due to language barriers that hinder their integration into the Quebec labour market. Retaining anglophone graduates in the province after they obtain their diplomas has become one of the most challenging problems faced by the Quebec government over the past decades. Notably, Quebec is the only province that has experienced net out-migration every year since 1963, and it has the highest out-migration. The issue has been a real problem for policymakers as the province experiences losses through out-migration of its potential skilled workers. This paper shows that the out-migration of skilled workers not only result in a loss of tax revenue but also contributes to Quebec’s debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding the recommended 45% threshold set by the International Monetary Fund. To explain Canadian interprovincial migration, I have constructed a model calibrated to Canadian economies and conducted policy simulations to identify effective strategies for retaining skilled workers.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In line with the sustainable development of northern Canada, extensive construction activities are taking place in local communities where the ground is composed of clay deposits. With a changing climate, the clay soil is expected to undergo more freeze-thaw cycles. This degradation poses a major threat to newly constructed infrastructure. Since soil is an essential part of the built environment, it is crucial to understand its behavior under freezing and thawing conditions. This thesis presents a comprehensive study on the mechanical and thermal-hydro-mechanical (THM) behaviors of frozen soils, focusing on both theoretical developments and practical applications. To achieve this, the research pays close attention to the interface between the compounds. It introduces a stiffness interface parameter to define complex interactions between clay-water composites and non-clay minerals at different temperatures. The key contribution of using this parameter includes developing a numerical homogenization model with the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to estimate the elastic properties of frozen clay soils. Subsequently, considering the interface between air-water capillary pressure and cryosuction, a two-dimensional THM finite element model was developed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to analyze the coupled processes in unsaturated freezing soils by incorporating temperature-dependent properties and phase changes. Finally, the behavior of permafrost under the operation of Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) systems in thawing permafrost regions has been analyzed as part of a geo-energy and geological engineering project in the subarctic region of Umiujaq in northern Quebec.
The study begins with an extensive literature review to establish the current state of knowledge and identify gaps in existing research. It then details the development and validation of numerical models, including their application to real-world scenarios. The findings highlight the importance of considering imperfect bonds between soil components, the complex interaction between air-water capillary pressure and cryosuction, the influence of phase change-induced strain, and the benefits and challenges of using GSHP systems in cold climates.
Despite the significant advancements made, the research acknowledges several limitations, such as the need for more complex soil structure representations and broader validation efforts. Recommendations for future work emphasize enhancing model complexity, conducting long-term studies, and integrating field data to improve the accuracy and applicability of the models.
Overall, this thesis advances the understanding of frozen soil mechanics and provides valuable tools for engineering applications in Arctic and subarctic regions. It contributes to the development of sustainable and resilient solutions for climate adaptation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Defending Object Detection Models against Image Distortions</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ofori-Oduro, Mark</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Object detection has significantly advanced with deep learning but faces challenges under image distortions like noise, compression, blur, fog, and snow. This issue is critical in applications such as self-driving cars and healthcare. While defence methods aim to enhance robustness under distortions, maintaining performance on clean images remains a challenge.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel defence approach that generates copies of the original training images and adds distortion-like content to these copies at the pixel level. We balance the number of distorted pixels to prevent bias during learning. Our approach includes two augmentation methods to generate augmented samples: AISbod, which uses artificial immune systems (AIS), and GSES, which employs kernel density estimation (KDE).

Our AISbod uses AIS to distort the original sample (antigen) through cycles of “select, clone, mutate, select” until the augmented data (antibody) reaches a specified similarity to the antigen. However, AIS is limited in diversifying generated antibodies and is computationally expensive. Therefore, in GSES, we create samples by selecting pixels from the original samples, estimating the pixel distribution from multiple distorted versions of the original samples via KDE, and then replacing the selected pixels with new values sampled from the estimated distribution. GSES generates more diverse data than AISbod.

We evaluate our methods on 15 image distortions using state-of-the-art object detection models like DINO and YOLOv7. Our methods improve accuracy under distorted and clean images and remain consistent across datasets and detection models. For instance, DINO on the COCO dataset shows a 4.50% improvement under clean samples, 8.40% on average across all distortions, 2.50% under snow, and 29.30% under impulse noise. The observed improvement is due to the weight regularization effect of our methods, which is evident in the smoother convergence of training and validation loss curves, indicating reduced learning fluctuations and a more stable optimization path. Additionally, the narrower gap between the curves suggests reduced over-fitting, leading to better generalization to unseen data. Simulations indicate that our approach outperforms related defence methods against distortions and extends beyond object detection, improving accuracy in image classification and object tracking models.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Alkali silica reaction (ASR) is a widely known deterioration mechanism in concrete; sufficient moisture and temperature are crucial for initiating and sustaining the reaction. The influence of these factors on ASR-induced expansion has been previously studied. However, little is known about their influence on ASR-induced damage. This work aims to apply a multi-level assessment protocol combining microscopic and mechanical properties tools to evaluate the impact of a wide range of moisture conditions and temperatures on ASR-induced expansion and deterioration. Concrete specimens were manufactured in the laboratory incorporating aggregates displaying different levels of reactivity (i.e., moderate, high, and very-high) and containing two alkali loadings (i.e., 3.82kg/m³ and 5.25kg/m³ Na2Oeq by mass of cement). The specimens were conditioned at five relativity humidities (i.e., 100%, 90%, 82%, 75%, and 62%) and three temperatures (i.e., 21°C, 38°C, and 60°C) and monitored for internal and external moisture, and ASR expansion over time. A time-based assessment was conducted, and upon reaching pre-defined ages (i.e., 3, 6, and 12 months), the Damage Rating Index (DRI), Stiffness Damage Test (SDT), Direct Shear, and compressive strength tests were conducted to appraise ASR-induced deterioration in the specimens. The results show that moisture inside concrete is typically around 90% RH from batching, which enables rapid ASR-induced expansion. However, lower external moisture reduces internal moisture and may induce shrinkage cracks that influence the overall damage pattern. Moreover, at elevated temperatures, ASR-induced cracks exhibit greater density but shorter length and narrower width compared to lower temperatures despite similar expansion levels. These conditions influence the microscopic and mechanical properties of ASR-affected concrete, with the DRI and SDT outcomes presenting a strong correlation to expansion. Through the multi-level assessment protocol, this study establishes that the moisture threshold required to trigger ASR is temperature- and aggregate-dependent. While the 80% RH has been widely used in the past, the findings of this study suggest that a lower range (62-75% RH) might be required for high temperatures and reactivity of the aggregates.  A novel damage classification table that accounts for a wider range of exposure conditions is thus proposed, offering a more comprehensive tool for the condition assessment of ASR-affected concrete.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Investigating freshwater bacterial diversity, community composition and function in hundreds of Canadian Lakes</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Freshwater bacterial communities play important roles in global biogeochemical cycling and aquatic food webs, yet bacterial diversity, community composition, and community metabolism in freshwater ecosystems remain less explored compared to terrestrial and marine
ecosystems. In this thesis work, I investigated bacterial communities in hundreds of lakes located across Canada, a country that contains millions of lakes. Utilizing 16S rRNA and metagenomic techniques, this research explores diversity patterns, community composition and functional
capabilities of lake bacterial communities and links variation in these three components to human-mediated alterations, specifically watershed land use types within lake watersheds. 

In the first research chapter, I performed an investigation of communities in 403 lakes from seven ecozones. I identified distinct bacterial diversity patterns between western (Semi-Arid Plateaux, Prairies, and
Boreal Plains ecozones) and eastern (Boreal Shield, Mixedwood Plains, Atlantic Maritimes, and Atlantic Highlands ecozones) Canada. The identified pattern was primarily influenced by lake physicochemistry including productivity, ion concentration, and lake depth. Bacterial community structure was influenced particularly by lake pH and trophic state. 

In the next research chapter, I expanded the study to 621 lakes across 12 ecozones and explored variation in diversity and community composition patterns in relation to water quality and land use. Total phosphorus (TP)
was identified as a key variable shaping community composition, with notable shifts occurring at 110 μg/L TP. Variation in bacterial communities within the Prairies ecozone were driven by agriculture while urbanisation played a role in structuring community composition within the
Pacific Maritimes ecozone. 

In the final research chapter, I investigated bacterial functional capabilities using gene-centric metagenomics. Physicochemical parameters emerged as top predictors of variation in functional gene composition, with xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism notably influenced. Overall, the research presented in this thesis demonstrates that bacterial diversity, community composition, and community function exhibit variations across continental and regional scales that can be attributed to within-lake conditions and watershed land use types.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Blackbox Security Auditing for Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Oqaily, Momen</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Over the past decade, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has revolutionized networking by leveraging virtualization to separate Network Functions (NFs) from dedicated physical hardware. However, this architecture introduces unique security risks, such as stealthy attacks causing discrepancies between tenant-level NF specifications and cloud provider-level deployment. To safely utilize NFV, robust security auditing mechanisms are crucial to ensure compliance and detect breaches. Yet, existing methods face challenges: NFV tenants have limited access to cloud infrastructure, and providers are hesitant to share data due to confidentiality concerns. Relying solely on providers for auditing may overlook tenant-specific requirements and legitimate modifications by attackers. Furthermore, current solutions often require unrealistic infrastructure modifications. This thesis introduces novel auditing solutions for both tenants and providers of NFV, addressing these limitations. Firstly, an interactive anonymization tool called iCAT facilitates selective, privacy-preserving data sharing between tenants and providers. It utilizes an anonymization space to model various anonymization techniques, translating requirements from both parties into suitable primitives using NLP and ontology modeling. Secondly, a tenant-based, two-stage solution enhances auditing autonomy. The first stage utilizes tenant-side information to detect integrity breaches, while the second stage anonymizes provider-level data for tenant verification, offering control, transparency, and accuracy in breach identification. Additionally, a cryptographic approach is combined with side-channel watermarking to bolster tenant security. This lightweight solution enables continuous detection and classification of cloud-level attacks on service function chains, encoding cryptographic trailers as side-channel watermarks. This approach ensures verifiable attack detection without significant overhead, overcoming challenges such as limited side channel capacity and packet delay. By addressing these issues, the proposed solutions aim to enhance the security of NFV deployments and enable safer utilization of this innovative networking architecture.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effects of Social Responsibility on Consumption Choices</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ortiz, Maria</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>socially responsible behavior; effort</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>In two essays, this dissertation examines the effect of socially responsible consumer behavior on subsequent consumption of conventional as well as socially responsible products. 

The first essay focuses on socially responsible behavior and subsequent consumption of conventional products and demonstrates that socially responsible behaviors increase the consumption amount of such conventional products. This effect is mediated by perceived effort associated with behaving socially responsibly. This research also shows that the effect is attenuated when consumers experience higher perceptions of control and when consumers are exposed to prosocial behavior conformity cues. This research expands the literature by identifying a novel contributor to overconsumption and highlights an unexpected consequence of socially responsible behavior. 

The second essay focuses on the consumption of socially responsible products. It shows that consumers are more likely to defer consumption of socially responsible products. It also finds that this effect is mediated by perceived effort, which generates positive inferences about the products’ specialness, resulting in consumption deferral. This research also demonstrates that the effect is attenuated by consumption goals and perceptions of low environmental benefits of socially responsible behaviors. This research contributes to the literature by identifying a novel contributor to consumption deferral and reveals an additional unexpected consequence of socially responsible products.

Overall, this reach enhances understanding of how consumers make decisions after their initial choice to behave socially responsibly, both in terms of conventional and socially responsible products. Furthermore, it clarifies the underlying process, showing that effort perceptions drive these effects.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Semi-Robust Risk Minimizing Hedging Strategies</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Osei Mireku, Emmanuel Sekyere</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores robust risk-minimizing hedging strategies for contingent claims in incomplete markets with transaction costs, offering a spectrum of tools to balance risk and cost effectiveness. Robust technique applications to finance and insurance have recently gained popularity due to their ability to mitigate model risk. Model risk arises when strategies (or models) become in and out of sync with the market. A model is robust if it can adapt to a wide range of market-dependent factors. However, robust models can be costly and computationally demanding, especially for complex financial and insurance products. Using a multidimensional event tree model, we employ the asymmetric norm as a semi-robust risk measure, integrating asymmetry for customized risk profiles. Three main strategies are developed: a super-replicating approach ensuring full claim coverage at a higher cost, the norm as constraint, which introduces controlled losses to reduce costs, and the norm as objective, minimizing losses directly to enhance capital efficiency. Additionally, self-financing strategies, which require no additional capital injections, offer cost-effective hedging, while portfolio value as state variable strategies allow real-time adjustments, enhancing robustness under volatile conditions. Testing on European call options show that semi-robust strategies - especially norm-constrained and self-financing approaches - maintain low tail risk with minimized cost, demonstrating versatility in adapting to diverse market conditions, investor goals, and risk tolerances while upholding robust risk control.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>CityEnergy Suite: A Holistic Approach to Modeling Occupant Behavior, Electric Vehicle Charging, and Demand Response in Urban Environments</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Osman, Mohamed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Occupant behavior; Synthetic population; EV charging; Demand response</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Quebec's ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 poses significant challenges in decarbonizing the building and transportation sectors while managing increasing electricity demand. A major obstacle is handling the temporal dynamics of electricity usage, especially unpredictable peak periods influenced by weather, economic activities, and consumer behavior. Efficient demand-side management (DSM) strategies, such as demand response (DR) and Vehicle to Grid (V2G), are essential to shift and flatten peak demand, ensuring a more sustainable and economically viable energy transition.
This thesis introduces the CityEnergy Suite, a comprehensive modeling framework for simulating residential energy-related behavior, electric vehicle (EV) charging, and DR strategies. Leveraging open-access datasets like Census data and energy surveys, the model generates high-resolution load profiles. The CityEnergy Suite employs a modular, agent-based approach to assess the aggregate impact of occupant behavior on the electrical grid and explore future energy scenarios. It comprises three key components: CityAgent, CityLoad, and CityCharge.
CityAgent creates a detailed synthetic population model tailored to the Montreal region, incorporating diverse household compositions and socio-economic characteristics. CityLoad produces stochastic energy load profiles that consider household attributes and appliance usage. CityCharge models urban EV charging demand, enabling analysis of different charging behaviors and penetration scenarios on the grid.
The findings provide crucial insights for developing decarbonization and DSM strategies, highlighting the potential of engaging small customers to support grid stability through load shifting, peak shaving, and emerging V2G technologies. The CityEnergy Suite offers a robust framework for designing inclusive and effective energy policies, contributing significantly to Quebec's decarbonization efforts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Impact of Cranberry-Derived Polyphenols on Physical Performance and Skeletal Muscle Bioenergetics</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Parenteau, Francis</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Dietary choices have a direct impact on the gut microbiome, which in turn influences several body functions. In recent years, polyphenols, which are plant secondary compounds, have been shown to have prebiotic-like effects and associated with multiple health benefits. Cranberries are native to North America and have the highest polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity among the commonly consumed fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, cranberries stand out due to their high levels of the rare A-type proanthocyanidin (PAC-1), which is believed to be the main contributor to the beneficial effects. Recently, the concept that a link between skeletal muscle and the host’s gut microbiota exists was put forward, with several research groups proposing that supplementation with polyphenols could promote improved muscle function, and consequently, improve exercise performance. One proposed mechanism for the positive effects of polyphenols on muscle function is through improved mitochondrial capacity. Mitochondria are the main producers of ATP, and their ability to generate energy as efficiently as possible is directly related to performance, especially in endurance athletes. The effect of cranberry polyphenols on exercise performance and skeletal mitochondrial function has not been explored before. This dissertation consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces key concepts to provide background information and states the rationale, objectives, and hypotheses of the dissertation. Chapter 2 describes a rodent study that aimed to investigate the effects of cranberry A-type proanthocyanidins combined with HIIT training on maximal running speed and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Chapter 3 consists of a systematic review with meta-analyses that synthesizes the current literature on the effects of polyphenol-rich berries on exercise performance, inflammation, and muscle damage. Chapter 4 is a clinical trial done with competitive/elite endurance runners that investigated the effects of a polyphenol-rich freeze-dried cranberry powder on running performance, lactate production, and skeletal muscle oxygenation. Chapter 5 is a follow-up study to the one described in Chapter 4 that aimed to explore the effects of the same cranberry powder on skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity using near-infrared spectroscopy in healthy active adults. Finally, Chapter 6 discusses the findings from chapters 2-5 and provides general limitations and future research directions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Is a Job (Like) a Jail? Differences in Metaphor Versus Simile Processing and Comprehension in L1 and L2 English Speakers</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Patalas, Iola</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>When listeners hear a metaphor such as jobs are jails, they typically understand the intended meaning even though such sentences are not literally true. Within psycholinguistics, there has been a lingering debate over how such phrases are understood, and how they differ from other related forms, such as similes (e.g., jobs are like jails). Accordingly, pragmatic theorists suggest that literal meaning of metaphors must first be rejected in order to attain understanding of intended metaphorical meaning from context and world knowledge. In contrast, direct-access theorists argue that both metaphor and simile are understood automatically, without prior parsing of literal semantic meaning. Relevant here, relatively little research has ascertained what meanings are attained during the time-course of metaphor or simile processing, and further, how this differs between first and second language speakers (henceforth, L1 and L2, respectively). To pursue this issue, this thesis presents three studies that investigate both the moment-by-moment online processing of metaphors and similes and their ultimate comprehensibility, in both L1 and L2 English speakers. STUDY 1 describes two cross-modal lexical decision experiments spanning four time points during the course of processing (vehicle word onset, vehicle recognition point, 500ms and 1000ms post-recognition point) in two samples of L1 English speakers, comparing the priming of literal and figurative meanings of metaphors and similes in high- and low- aptness and familiarity conditions. It showed that aptness and familiarity modulated which meanings were activated during metaphor and simile processing, and that literal meanings were activated faster and lingered later than figurative meanings. STUDY 2 repeated the same experimental design in a sample of L2 English speakers, with four time points collapsed into two (early and late) to determine whether L2 speakers process metaphors the same way L1 speakers do. We demonstrated that L2 speakers did not appreciably prime figurative or literal meanings during online processing of metaphors, and only primed literal meanings while processing similes. STUDY 3 probed whether L1 and L2 speakers found metaphors and similes globally comprehensible when aptness and familiarity were manipulated and when given ample time to make offline judgments about these sentences. It found that L1 speakers judged highly familiar metaphor more comprehensible than similes that had the same constituents. However, L2 speakers preferred simile when sentence familiarity was high or aptness was low. Together, STUDIES 1 to 3 highlight that online processing and offline comprehension of metaphor and simile differed according to language background and sentence attributes. Specifically, familiarity was important for both online processing of metaphor and simile for L1 speakers. In contrast, L2 speakers relied more heavily on semantic decomposability to make sense of figurative expressions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Online Condition Monitoring of Stator Winding Insulation State of Electric Machines in Electrified Vehicles</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Patel, Ashutosh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Electrified vehicles commonly use traction machines powered by voltage source inverters (VSI) for efficient speed and torque control. However, short circuit faults and insulation failures remain prevalent, accounting for approximately 30% of motor failures. Given the uncertainties surrounding insulation degradation, detecting degradations of insulation in an early stage can help prevent major failures. Therefore, this Ph.D. research focuses on online monitoring of electrical machine’s winding insulation degradation.
A comprehensive review of literature revealed certain research gaps. The first one is on selection of the most effective insulation degradation indicator for online condition monitoring without increasing motor drive costs. To address this challenge, this research uses existing signals in EV motor drives, such as line current measurements. However, there is limited information on how insulation degradation can impact the line currents in the existing literature. Therefore, this Ph.D. work address this knowledge gap through conducting investigations of insulation indicators. It is found that the antiresonance oscillations in line current can serve as indicators for insulation degradation, which was not reported in the existing literature. 
Existing literature on condition monitoring methods also presents notable limitations. Firstly, these techniques can not determine the degradation of groundwall (GW) or turn-to-turn (TT) insulations simultaneously. There is a need for a new approach for simultaneous condition monitoring of TT and GW insulations. This is crucial because different types of insulation are exposed to different temperatures, leading to a varied degradation rate. Additionally, current methods overlooked the variability of noise in measured signals, which can fluctuate due to various factors in real-world applications like EVs. This variability necessitates a condition monitoring approach that can handle noise while accurately determining insulation health. Moreover, existing methods rely on predefined thresholds and manual analysis, requiring expert interpretation, which limits their applicability across different machines and conditions. Hence, this Ph.D. work proposes novel methodologies to address these limitations. A technique for simultaneous monitoring of TT and GW insulation conditions has been proposed. To address the limitation posed by noise variability and the reliance on manual analyses, a novel data-driven methodology for robust insulation condition monitoring has been proposed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The forefront of EV battery charger research accentuates the imperative of refining power density attributes while concurrently elevating the efficiency standards of power conversion processes. The conventional EV battery chargers are developed with two cascaded power conversion stages. The first stage converts the AC voltage to a DC voltage by employing power factor correction (PFC). The second stage is an isolated DC-DC converter stage. These two-stages are interconnected by DC-link capacitors. This two-stage battery charger suffers from low overall efficiency due to two different power conversion stages. At the same time, the power density is limited due to the inevitable presence of intermediate DC-link capacitors. Generally, high-value electrolytic capacitors are selected for the DC-link. More importantly, the battery charger is placed close to the internal combustion engine under the hood in the case of a plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV), where the ambient temperature is more than 150 °C. The electrolytic capacitors are most susceptible to failure at high ambient temperature, thus the reliability of the conventional two-stage EV battery charger is low in a high-temperature environment. Moreover, the existing research on battery chargers is mainly based on voltage-fed power converter topologies, where the feasibility of current-fed power converter topologies has received very limited attention.
This thesis work proposes and studies a family of novel snubber-less current-fed isolated single-stage bidirectional power converters (AC-DC and DC-DC) for multifunctional EV battery charging (G2V, V2G, and V2V) applications to address the shortcomings of the conventional two-stage battery chargers. The proposed modulation strategy and control technique are demonstrated for promising soft-switching operation of all semiconductor devices with bidirectional power flow capability. These converters enable zero current commutated (ZCC) without any active clamp circuit or passive snubbers, which significantly reduced switching losses, footprints, and cost. The converters steady-state operation and design equations are reported in detail. The simulation results from PSIM 11.04 software and the experimental results from 1.5 kW proof-of-concept laboratory hardware prototypes are provided in order to validate the report analysis, design, and performance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Comparative Study of the Effects of Device Geometry on the DC Characteristics, Linearity and Low-Frequency Noise Performance of Lattice-matched InAlN/GaN HFETs</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Patel, Yatexu</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The novel lattice-matched HFETs realized on an epilayer consisting of a thin In0.17Al0.83N barrier layer grown on top of an undoped GaN channel have been demonstrated over the past decade to enjoy improved stable high-frequency power characteristics compared to their famous AlGaN/GaN counterparts. This is specially thanks to employing a lattice-matched barrier enjoying substantial spontaneous polarization-induced sheet charge density. 
An extensive body of research implies a significant correlation exists between electronic device technology, the level of 1/f noise, and the manifestation of generation–recombination (G-R) bulge signatures. This correlation has been shown to offer a highly sensitive foundation for reliability and further performance optimization of electronic devices. A decrease in low frequency noise (LFN) has a significant impact on oscillator phase noise and the performance of intermediate frequency (IF) amplifiers and mixers Thus, in this thesis, the low frequency drain noise-current characteristics of metallic-face InAlN/AlN/GaN heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs) having fin structures only under the gate, while maintaining a planar structure in the access regions, are compared to those of the HFETs having fin structures stretched from source to drain. This work aims to address the possible difficulties in the performance of these devices. Evidence indicates that both device types follow the trends of carrier number fluctuation (CNF) with correlated mobility fluctuation (CMF) model of 1/f noise. Devices having fin structures just under the gate are exhibiting improved 1/f noise performance with lower drain noise-current spectral density. 

Since a good gate-transconductance (Gm) linearity, specially at high gate over-drives, is essential to linear high-frequency amplifiers intended for use in modern telecommunication system (such as 6G networks), enhancing the linearity of the deeply scaled HFETs implemented on such epilayers is very much in demand. Moreover, the investigation of the on-state breakdown mechanism is beneficial for the definition and design of the safe operation area (SOA) in GaN-based high power amplifiers and switches. In this thesis, I have investigated the impact of the scaling of the gate-source length (LGS) and gate length (LG) on the DC characterises and gate-transconductance (Gm) linearity of metallic-face InAlN/AlN/GaN heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs) having fin structures only under the gate and those having them stretched from source to drain. Evidence for both device types suggests that the downscaling of LGS and LG augments the electron velocity in the source-access region, as a result of which the higher carrier density under the gated-channel improves the maximum drain-current density but not necessarily the Gm linearity of the device. It is shown that the devices having a planar and longer source access region are exhibiting relatively improved gate-transconductance linearity. In addition, the downscaling of the LG is observed to have a positive influence on device linearity. However, the negative impact of the downscaling of the LGS and LG on the on-state breakdown voltage has been observed. 
In addition, in this thesis I have investigated the effect of partially etching of the gated barrier on the Gm linearity of lattice-matched InAlN/GaN HFETs. Simulation results show an improvement in linearity observed through broadening the gate transconductance characteristics of Vth-modulated HFETs over the non-recessed and an alternative recessed HFET, for which gated barrier was uniformly recessed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Dams are vital national assets that play a crucial role in water storage, hydroelectric power generation, and flood control. Globally, over 61,000 large dams have surpassed 50 years of service, and many show signs of deterioration. With over 300 dam failures recorded worldwide, the potential for catastrophic damage remains alarmingly high if these aging structures are not properly maintained and upgraded. Further, many of the existing dams were built upon outdated standards, and there is an increase in seismic hazards making it imperative to reevaluate their seismic performance to align with current safety standards. The need for improved dam safety measures is urgent, as dam owners, regulators, and policymakers grapple with the challenges of ensuring the structural integrity of aging dams in the face of growing risks. A key solution is shifting from traditional safety approaches to a modern, risk-based methodology, which addresses safety concerns more efficiently and economically. Various, global agencies have developed risk-based safety assessment guidelines; however, these often lack systematic implementation frameworks and sufficient reference studies, making them difficult for dam owners to adopt effectively. Furthermore, various uncertainties can impact the risk assessment and can complicate efforts to ensure dam safety. In this context, this research investigates uncertainties impacting seismic risk assessments for dams, including modeling choices, ground motion selection, aging, and material variability. Case studies of the Koyna Dam and Pine Flat Dam were used to evaluate these factors at each stage of performance evaluation: system response, fragility, and risk assessment. Key findings indicate that dam-foundation-reservoir (DFR) models incorporating acoustic elements exhibit less variability in system response, regardless of model complexity and solution procedure. Ground motion derived from the conditional mean spectrum (CMS) method yields better fragility estimates than the ASCE 7-16 standard, particularly for moderate to severe damage states. Additionally, aging and material variability significantly affect the dynamic characteristics of dams, with increased failure probabilities correlating with both age and return period. Based on these findings, the research proposes a comprehensive, systematic framework for risk-based seismic safety evaluation. This framework aligns with safety assessment objectives and ensures optimal use of computational resources.</etd_ms:description>

Early Childhood Educators’ Perspectives on Love and Care 
Katherine Pauls, Ph.D.
Concordia University, 2024

The concept of love in early childhood education is complex and challenging to define. However, understanding early childhood educators' views on love is essential for supporting educators and children in childcare settings. This phenomenological study examines early childhood educators’ beliefs and expressions of love and how they differentiate between love and care in their interactions with children. Their perspectives include, amongst others, influences from parents, coworkers and children. Eight early childhood educators from Montreal, Canada, who work with children under five years of age were recruited for this study. They participated in in-depth individual and focus group interviews. During the interviews, the participants were asked questions about their perspectives on love and care in their childcare settings as well as inspirations and challenges to showing love. They each gave concrete examples of how they showed love, including physical affection, curriculum actions and emotional support. The focus group discussions allowed participants to share their thoughts on personal and traditional definitions of love, deepening the dialogue around these complex concepts. The data was analyzed using In Vivo and Emotion coding and four themes were identified: (1) How Educators Believe They Show Love, (2) Factors That Educators Believe Shape the Way They Show Love, (3) Factors Educators Believe Act as Barriers and Challenges to Showing Love, and (4) How Educators Understand Love and Care in Their Work. These themes provide valuable insights into the educators' experiences and interactions within early childhood settings, highlighting the emotional intricacies of their roles, specifically as they alter their expressions of love and care for the children. This research has important implications for early childhood education training and support, helping pre-service teachers better understand their work's emotional dimensions and navigate the challenges of forming and maintaining meaningful relationships in childcare environments.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Reframing the Game: How the interaction between technology, culture, and marketing plays along in the platform society.</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The video game industry has substantially transformed itself in the last decade. Game companies had to adapt to fit into the new logic of production and consumption dominating the global market. In the continuous evolution of digital communication, technologies like social network systems, mobile devices, app stores, and live-streaming broadcasting allied to their capacity to gather and move a large amount of user data, have each played crucial roles in speeding up the rate of change in the game industry. This rapid transformation has also affected players. While expert players had to adapt to new ways of paying for and playing games, subjecting themselves to new designs, mechanics and gameplay, newbies found new opportunities to expand their gameplay.
Drawing from Kline et al. (2003), this dissertation examines the current state of the game industry, underlining the significant changes it has been facing over the years. In their scholarship, Kline and colleagues developed an analytical tool to investigate the video game medium in the context of a high-intensity marketplace. I make use of their circuitry to investigate the current context surrounding the game industry. In broad strokes, this study examines how the industry’s new business models and strategies influence and leverage these circuits, which, in turn, interferes, accelerates, and intensifies the interconnections between them, generating new layers of interactivity at every turn. 
The video game industry is massive in scope, and its business strategies vary according to each developer’s size and ambitions. Thus, this research focuses on two mainstream companies as a case study: Electronic Arts and Tencent. By following these companies' production practices and business strategies in the last decade, this study attempts to understand the processes that shaped the game industry during the 2010s. This research uses critical political economy and textual analysis as methodological tools to look closely at a large corpus of documents. As this research demonstrates, the interplay between the circuits tends to be guided by the marketing circuit; accordingly, the intense acceleration between the circuits and the formation of new layers of interactivity entail the reduction of social and cultural relationships to mere monetary transactions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Climatic Drivers of Biodiversity: Influence on Ecophylogenetics and Specialization Across Spatial Scales</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Climate plays a critical role in shaping the diversity, structure, and evolutionary history of ecological communities across spatial and temporal scales. In my thesis, I investigate how three dimensions of climate—--average, variability, and frequency across space—--determine the phylogenetic structure and climatic specialization of biological communities worldwide, focusing on bats and tetrapods. In the first chapter, I explore how historical and contemporary processes, such as palaeoclimatic stability, geographical isolation, and local diversification rates, influence the global phylogenetic structure of bat communities. My findings reveal that stable climates since the Last Glacial Maximum have promoted phylogenetic clustering, while geographical isolation and varying diversification rates further shape community structure across different scales. In the second chapter, I examine the underexplored role of the spatial frequency of climate—how often specific climatic conditions occur across space—on specialization within biological communities. Through a combination of global analyses of tetrapods and theoretical simulations, I demonstrate that rare climates limit specialization, favouring the coexistence of generalists and specialists, whereas common climates promote specialization across tetrapod taxa and their communities. Finally, in the third chapter, I investigate how climatic commonness and rarity influence the phylogenetic structure and suitability of tetrapod communities. I find that rare climates are less supportive of closely related species, with recent ecological dynamics playing a more significant role than deep evolutionary constraints. Overall, my thesis provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted role of climate in shaping biodiversity, offering valuable insights into biodiversity responses to climatic variation, including ongoing rapid climate change.

Le climat joue un rôle crucial dans la diversité, la structure et l'histoire évolutive des communautés écologiques à différentes échelles spatiales et temporelles. Dans ma thèse, j'étudie comment trois dimensions du climat—la moyenne, la variabilité et la fréquence spatiale—déterminent la structure phylogénétique et la spécialisation climatique des communautés biologiques à l'échelle mondiale, en me concentrant sur les chauves-souris et les tétrapodes. Dans le premier chapitre, j'explore l'influence des processus historiques et contemporains, tels que la stabilité paléoclimatique, l'isolement géographique et les taux de diversification locale, sur la structure phylogénétique globale des communautés de chauves-souris. Mes résultats montrent que les climats stables depuis le dernier maximum glaciaire favorisent le regroupement phylogénétique, tandis que l'isolement géographique et les taux de diversification variables modulent la structure des communautés à différentes échelles. Dans le deuxième chapitre, j'examine le rôle sous-estimé de la fréquence spatiale du climat—c'est-à-dire la récurrence de certaines conditions climatiques dans l'espace—sur la spécialisation au sein des communautés biologiques. Grâce à une combinaison d'analyses globales des tétrapodes et de simulations théoriques, je démontre que les climats rares limitent la spécialisation, favorisant la coexistence des généralistes et des spécialistes, tandis que les climats communs encouragent la spécialisation. Enfin, dans le troisième chapitre, j'étudie comment la fréquence et la rareté climatiques influencent la structure phylogénétique et l'adéquation des communautés de tétrapodes. Je constate que les climats rares soutiennent moins les espèces étroitement apparentées, les dynamiques écologiques récentes jouant un rôle plus déterminant que les contraintes évolutives profondes. Ma thèse offre ainsi une compréhension approfondie du rôle complexe du climat dans la formation de la biodiversité, apportant des perspectives précieuses sur les réponses de la biodiversité aux variations climatiques, y compris le changement climatique rapide en cours.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Harnessing Digital and Droplet Microfluidics to Advance
Synthetic Biology</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Perry, James M.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>As we strive to engineer biological systems, we must first understand the fundamental parts. This requires
us to examine vast arrays of genetic variation, potentially ranging from hundreds to millions of subtle differences
for each system, highlighting a need for high-throughput automation. Such automation is essential,
not only for facilitating rapid development through continuous cycles of design, construction, and testing,
but ultimately to integrate with machine learning algorithms: a synergy that will bypass the sluggish tempo
of natural evolution and unleash a massive wave of synthetic biology.
In addressing automation needs, this thesis delves into the development and implementation of droplet
and digital microfluidics technologies. These innovations mark a significant breakthrough in automation
while also introduce added benefits of miniaturization. Additionally, the use of optogenetics to control gene
expression presents an opportunity to interface biology with the highly established field of digital control
systems.
The thesis is structured into distinct chapters, each contributing uniquely to the field. The foreword acts
as a guide for the thesis. The first chapter offers a thorough exploration of droplet microfluidics in synthetic
biology, highlighting its critical role and projecting its contribution to the forthcoming bio-revolution.
This is followed by three primary research studies. The first study details innovative techniques in digital
microfluidics for DNA assembly and transformation. The second study focuses on developing optogenetic
control of gene expression, using a model-based design strategy. The third study discusses the integration
of optogenetic systems within a droplet-in-channel microfluidic environment, showcasing the potential for
future applications in synthetic biology and beyond. The concluding chapter serves as a reflection and ties
these works to a greater synthetic biology vision.
Through these studies, this thesis not only addresses the immediate needs of automation in synthetic biology
but also establishes a foundation for future research, highlighting the need for microfluidic technologies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Sufism in Late Mamlūk Cairo: The Mystical Teachings of Ibn Mughayzil (fl. 895/1490)</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Polinsky, Sheridan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation is a study of the Egyptian Sufi Ibn Mughayzil in four chapters. Chapter 1 investigates his life, activity, and teachers, in addition to his place within the Egyptian Shādhiliyya. I show that his discipleship of Muḥammad al-Maghribī, a prominent Shādhilī master, and his studies under such notable scholars as Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūṭī and Shams al-Dīn al-Sakhāwī linked him to the Sufi and scholarly elite of Cairo and created the opportunity for him to pursue the eighth deputyship of one of the two main lines of the Egyptian Shādhiliyya. Although it does not appear that he was ever recognized as that deputy, his legacy was ensured by his two known writings: al-Kawākib al-zāhira fī ijtimāʿ al-awliyāʾ yaqẓatan bi-Sayyid al-Dunyā wa-l-Ākhira, a comprehensive treatment of Sufi topics; and al-Qawl al-ʿalī fī tarāduf al-muʿjiza bi-karāmat al-walī, a brief treatise mainly on saints’ miracles. I examine these works in Chapter 2, illustrating their pertinence to late Mamlūk Sufism through their focus on such themes as the relationship between Law (sharīʿa) and Reality (ḥaqīqa), the saints’ miracles, and Sufi epistemology. I reveal Ibn Mughayzil to be a strong defender of the Sufis and a devout Shādhilī, while distinguishing his text from two contemporary Shādhilī manuals by al-Suyūṭī and Aḥmad Zarrūq. Chapter 3 offers a close study of the author’s treatment of select issues concerning God and His relation to the world, including His oneness and manifestations, the eternality and creation of the world, the Muḥammadan Spirit (al-rūḥ al-muḥammadiyya), the vision of God in this world and the next, and religious diversity. I introduce Ibn Mughayzil as a synthetic and creative thinker, engaging a rich body of literature to develop his positions. I suggest, nevertheless, that his determination to defend the orthodoxy of certain Sufi doctrines engenders his tolerance of diverse views and, in some cases, ambiguity in his own stances. Chapter 4 explores the key topic of the Kawākib, the waking vision of Prophet Muḥammad after his death. Beginning with a brief history of the phenomenon up until Ibn Mughayzil’s time, I show that it had grown increasingly common—especially among the Shādhiliyya—and became the object of a heated debate in ninth/fifteenth-century Cairo. I argue that Ibn Mughayzil makes a crucial intervention by theorizing the waking vision in a way that honours traditional distinctions and views, thus appealing to scholars who had been skeptical about the possibility and orthodoxy of the vision. I also demonstrate that Ibn Mughayzil’s attention to the waking vision anticipates its increased significance in later centuries in ritual and as a source of spiritual authority. In the conclusion, I contend that study of a late Mamlūk Sufi text like the Kawākib can help us appreciate scholarship of the period and challenge the notion of a literary decline.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Computational modeling of wind flow and wind-induced loads on low buildings</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Potsis, Theodore</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>wind engineering, wind loads, computational fluid dynamics, large eddy simulation, dynamic terrain</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Moving towards a new era where structural engineering applications will rely more on Computational Fluid Dynamics as means to evaluate wind related characteristics, this thesis demonstrates a novel computational technique to model wind flow and wind-induced structural loads. During the last decades there have been continuous efforts in modelling efficiently turbulent flows by the practice and scientific community. Various methodologies have been discussed in the literature, but their applicability for structural design remains problematic, thus wind design standards and codes of practice hesitate to adopt computational procedures for structural loads. Therefore, a new tool that serves the engineering needs while respecting the scientific requirements has been developed.
The so-called Dynamic Terrain method utilizes velocity time series extracted from the Concordia Wind Tunnel as inlet conditions. A first target achieved was to model accurately the energy of the fluctuations of turbulence scales that are smaller than the building characteristic dimensions. This accomplishment covers a research gap in the state-of-the-art identified during a comprehensive review study. Another achievement is the ability of the method to model various exposure conditions, in addition to the characteristic standard open, suburban and urban exposures. Quasi-steady conditions are assumed for the inlet time series as to respect physical aspects such as the divergence-free criteria and numerical stability. The final pressure time series are extracted by filtering the numerical data to account for the inherent discontinuity of the inlet conditions and their propagation in the computational domain. 
With this engineering tool, modeling of wind flow and peak pressures on building envelopes become possible via simple procedures and advantageous techniques, compared with similar approaches currently available. Validation of wind flow and pressure characteristics are presented for various structural applications. Mean, std and peak pressures have been validated for loads on low-rise buildings based on experiments from TPU, NIST and the Concordia Wind Tunnel. The accuracy is within acceptable margins established by comparisons among the experimental results from respective wind tunnel facilities. The tool is incorporated in an open database, where experimental data from the Concordia Wind Tunnel and OpenFOAM libraries are included for free usage by practitioners and scientific groups.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Predicting User Performance for the Evaluation of User Interfaces in Immersive Augmented Reality</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Pourmemar, Majid</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Augmented Reality (AR) is defined as the enhancement of the user's view with interactive, computer-generated content, and arises in several forms, including Mobile AR, Spatial AR, and notably, Immersive AR. Among these, immersive AR has piqued considerable attention from both academia and industry.  It enables users to immerse themselves in virtual content registered to real-world objects through head-mounted displays (HMDs) and optics technology. Providing robust interaction with virtual objects has necessitated immersive headset designers and producers to develop a broad array of interaction techniques and input modalities, enabling users to experience both a natural interaction with virtual objects and a profound sense of presence. Well-known companies in this domain, such as Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Magic Leap, have pioneered various interactions and input modalities such as hand gestures, head pointing, eye tracking, and voice commands. The current state of the art indicates that specific input modalities, like hand gestures and head pointing, can increase both the physical and mental workload on users, subsequently increasing the error margins in object selection and manipulation within immersive environments. In response, this research adeptly applies statistical and contemporary machine learning techniques to establish guidelines for immersive AR environment designers and developers, aiming to mitigate the effects of physical and mental workload on users, particularly during hierarchical menu selection tasks, a commonplace activity in various computer applications, including immersive AR. This thesis, embodied by four research papers, extends guidelines and recommendations for designers and developers of immersive AR headsets, endeavoring to alleviate workload and error rates induced by natural interactions such as hand gestures and head pointing while performing hierarchical menu selection. The initial research focused on identifying the most efficient combination of hierarchical menu types, like radial and drop-down menus, and input modalities, such as hand gestures and head pointing in terms of workload and performance measures. The subsequent study deployed a machine learning approach, leveraging semantic encoders and the standard cognitive performance test, WAIS-IV, to predict human performance in an immersive AR environment during hierarchical menu selection tasks. The third research introduces an analysis and index for error rate in hierarchical menu selection, utilizing both subjective and objective data derived from the users. The final research is an analysis of head pointing and hand gesture path data during menu selection tasks, elucidating an index and its relationship with both subjective and objective methods for calculating workload and error rate in immersive AR.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Robust and Fast Schemes for Generation of Matched Features in MIS Images</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Pourshahabi, Muhammad Reza</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Feature Detection, Extraction, and Matching
Feature Matching Refinement
Minimally Invasive Surgery</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers numerous benefits including smaller incisions, faster recovery, enhanced precision, and remote operations. Image processing operations such as 3D visualization, augmented reality, and image registration, which are often feature-based, are used in MIS. Feature detection, extraction, and matching (FDEM) and feature matching refinement (FMR) constitute the cornerstone of these operations. MIS images are affected by deformation, occlusions, and specular reflection, which hinder the processes of FDEM and FMR, severely affecting the number of matched features.
FDEM is a process in which, given a pair of images, certain distinctive features are detected from the pair, then suitably represented as feature vectors, and finally, the corresponding feature vectors are compared and matched leading to a set of matched features known as a putative set for the pair. On the other hand, FMR is a process in which the falsely matched pairs of features are, as much as possible, removed from a putative set. The existing FDEM and FMR schemes are computationally expensive or lead to a set of matched features that are not well dispersed over the region of interest and suffer from having an insufficient number of true matches.
The overall objective of this thesis is to propose robust and fast schemes for generation of matched features in MIS images. In the first part of the thesis, a very fast and accurate FMR scheme is proposed. The main idea used in developing this scheme is in determining the size of local neighborhoods so that the smoothness of deformation field can be effectively applied to check the feature topology preservation between the corresponding regions of the pair of images to identify the true matches in the putative set of the pair. In the second part, a fast and accurate FDEM scheme that combines the strong attributes of three well-known FDEM schemes, SIFT, SURF and ORB, is proposed. The focus is on producing putative sets of matched features that have a good spatial quality in addition to a good matching quality. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FMR and FDEM schemes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Enhanced Diagnosis of Breast Cancer through Detection of Exosomes using ex-situ, in-situ, and Solid State Dewetted Nanoplasmonic Platforms</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Raju, Duraichelvan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death and the second most common among women in Canada. This thesis aims to develop sensing nanoplasmonic platforms for the early diagnosis of breast cancer through the detection of exosomes. The adsorption of bio or organic molecules on metallic nanoparticles leads to a plasmon band shift towards longer wavelengths; a phenomenon central to Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR). This study aims to develop nano-structured arrays of plasmonic platforms for the high-performance detection of sub-micron biological entities such as viruses, exosomes, and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) ranging from 30 - 1000 nm. 
This thesis particularly focuses on developing and optimizing unique plasmonic platforms for detecting EVs/exosomes derived from breast cancer cell lines. These EVs/exosomes are nano-sized (30 - 100 nm), cargo-bearing vesicles secreted by almost all cell types, consisting of a lipid bilayer encasing a semi-fluid core of cytoplasmic materials, including proteins, nucleic acids, and exhibit significant heterogeneity, reflecting their cellular origin. Despite their potential as biomarkers for diseases like cancer, their heterogeneity and overlapping physicochemical properties with other vesicles pose challenges for effective detection, separation, and purification.
In the beginning, two different types of platforms, one fabricated by an ex-situ method and the other by an in-situ method, were investigated to find out which was more convenient in terms of sensitivity for detecting EVs/exosomes. Different fabrication conditions have been explored and the sensitivity of the platforms has been measured. A sensing protocol involving several steps has been developed and optimized for detecting EVs/exosomes. It has been found that the platform prepared by an ex-situ method, that is, by convective assembly of gold colloidal particles, is more sensitive than the silver (Ag)-PDMS and gold (Au)-PDMS nanocomposite platforms fabricated by an in-situ method. In the case of gold (Au)-PDMS, gold is segregated under the surface of the polymer, without direct contact with the environment, and thus not suitable for detection. 
Additionally, to improve the refractive index sensitivity, novel platforms have been investigated. This thesis is further dedicated to developing and characterizing new plasmonic platforms, based on nano-islands/particles, fabricated from thin gold films e-beam deposited on an adhesion layer. The nano-islands/particles fabricated by the dewetting of the uniform gold films deposited on Chromium (Cr) (Cr-Au) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) adhesion layers (ITO-Au), respectively. Subsequently, based on the characterization results, the Cr-Au platform has been identified for the detection of EVs/exosomes. In addition, a direct detection method as well was developed without any surface chemistry modification of the plasmonic platform. The detection results obtained by using this novel platform and method were compared with the results of the ex-situ, and in-situ platforms studied earlier in this thesis work. It was found that, with the novel platform and method, the sensitivity of detection improved around 1.5 times, and the time taken for the detection was reduced by around one-fourth of the time of the earlier method. 
This work also provided invaluable information, regarding the adhesion layers, and their characteristics, especially stability, in association with very thin gold films. The phenomena of interdiffusion and oxidation during the deposition and heat treatment and their effect on detection have been studied as well.
Overall, this work contributes to the development of cost-effective, high-performance nanoplasmonic platforms, for early diagnosis of breast cancer establishing a foundation for their broader application in detecting and analyzing diverse biological and environmental samples.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Transmission of Shocks on Real Assets of Corporations to Their Financial Performance</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rasteh, Mehdi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates how shocks to real assets impact the financial performance of corporations.
The first study examines drought shocks and their effect on bank financial stability and loan performance. Unlike other climate shocks, droughts are slow and their effects are not immediate. By defining a two-year drought shock at the bank level and using a difference-in-differences methodology, it is found that drought shocks significantly worsen banks' Z-Score, return on assets, and stock volatility. Additionally, non-performing loans increase substantially in affected banks compared to unaffected ones. The economic impacts of droughts are comparable to a 1% decline in the unemployment rate. Affected banks tend to close branches in drought-impacted regions without increasing their capital ratios.
The second study investigates the impact of human mobility reductions during the COVID-19 pandemic on bank performance. Using geographic locations of bank branches to measure exposure to mobility declines, the study finds that U.S. banks' stability, profitability, and asset quality are negatively affected by reduced mobility. There is a significant rise in non-performing consumer loans, residential, and commercial mortgages, while commercial loans remain unaffected. Relationship banking provides a protective buffer against the adverse effects of mobility reductions on banks.
The third study assesses the role of unpledged collateral in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) concerning liquidity constraints and asset sales. The findings indicate that REITs with higher ratios of encumbered assets tend to sell properties at lower prices and face increased loan spreads. Encumbrance restricts the pool of assets available for disposal, reducing profits from selling activities. However, the negative impact of encumbrance on selling activity and loan spreads is mitigated for financially healthy REITs. Overall, the study underscores the importance of unencumbered assets as a determinant of selling activity and borrowing costs.
Collectively, these studies provide valuable insights into how different types of shocks affect financial stability, loan performance, and asset sales, highlighting the critical role of asset management and strategic responses in mitigating adverse outcomes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring CC- and A-Adding tRNA Nucleotidyltransferases in the Eukaryote Schizosaccharomyces pombe</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Reid, Nathalie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (tRNA-NT) is required in all eukaryotes to add a specific cytidine-cytidine-adenosine (CCA) sequence at the 3′-terminus of all tRNAs. This sequence is added post-transcriptionally during tRNA maturation or repair to prepare a tRNA for aminoacylation prior to protein synthesis. Moreover, tRNA-NTs perform additional roles in tRNA quality control and transport such that they must be present in mitochondria, the nucleus, and cytosol to perform their functions. As the majority of eukaryotes, characterized to date, have a single nuclear gene encoding tRNA-NTs that must be targeted to different cellular destinations, this enzyme has served as a model for research into how the products of a single gene can be targeted to multiple subcellular localizations.

In this study, we showed through in vivo complementation assays and in vitro activity assays that rather than having a single gene encoding a CCA-adding tRNA-NT, Schizosaccharomyces pombe was the first eukaryote characterized to have two genes, cca1 and cca2, whose gene products add first CC and then A, respectively. To understand the differences between the eukaryotic two-enzyme system (separate CC- and A-adding activities) and the single enzyme CCA-adding system, we explored aspects of the activity and localization of these novel eukaryotic CC- and A-adding enzymes.

After defining the CC- and A-adding activities of Cca1 and Cca2, we used site-directed mutagenesis to show that, as in CCA-adding enzymes, changes in conserved motifs C and A, generated and suppressed, respectively, a temperature-sensitive phenotype. This suggests that although for CC- or A-adding enzymes the reorganization of the active site need not be as dramatic as is seen in CCA-adding enzymes which must change conformation from pyrimidine binding (CC) to purine binding (A), there are still conformational changes important for enzyme activity in the CC- and A-adding proteins. Although changes in the tail domain of Cca2, the A-adding enzyme, had little impact on A-addition, similar changes in the same region of Cca1, the CC-adding enzyme, resulted in reduced growth. As the tail domain is thought to play a role in tRNA binding this suggests that in CC-addition, substrate selection or rearrangement of the tRNA is partially controlled by this region. Conversely, the C-terminus is less important for A-addition. Moreover, in vivo, the tRNA released from the CC-adding enzyme must move to the A-adding enzyme to complete CCA addition. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that Cca1 and Cca2 can be found together when RNA is present suggesting potential channeling of the tRNA intermediate from one enzyme to the next.

Eukaryotic tRNA-NTs must perform their functions in multiple cellular compartments and therefore must contain features not required in bacteria to regulate their subcellular localizations. We found through growth studies using heterologous expression that the absence of the native promoters of cca1 and cca2 causes a 50% increase in doubling times suggesting that some aspects of regulation occur in their promoter regions. Moreover, we showed that both Cca1 and Cca2 possess amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signals that can restore localization to a truncated S. cerevisiae CCA-adding enzyme. Finally, through proximity-labelling, we identified 20 potential interactions of Cca1 and/or Cca2 with other proteins of which a nucleoporin usually positioned at the nuclear basket is a potential interaction partner for the CC-adding but not A-adding enzyme.

This exploration of the S. pombe tRNA-NTs has highlighted differences among organisms in the activities and localization strategies for genes with multiple localizations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Stress and family dysfunction: Examining their influence on mental health outcomes and service use in the offspring of parents with affective disorders</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Resendes, Tiffany</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Offspring of parents with affective disorders (OAD) are at risk of developing a wide range of mental disorders. Deficits in the rearing environment and exposure to adverse events are well known risk factors for negative outcomes in OAD. Building on prior research, this thesis aimed to examine the longitudinal relationships between familial dysfunction, exposure to adverse events, emotional and behavioural well-being, and mental health service utilization in OAD and control offspring of parents with no affective disorder. Studies 1 and 2 in the thesis used data from the TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal study of youth in the Netherlands. 2230 participants (51% female, Mage= 11.1 years, SD = 0.6, at baseline) and their parents completed questionnaires across 6 time points, spanning 15 years. Mental health and behavioural data were measured using standardized questionnaires, while adverse life events and health service utilization were assessed using structured interviews. In the first study, multi- group structured equation modelling revealed that family dysfunction was linked to internalizing and externalizing problems in the OAD (B = 0.05, SD = 0.02, p = .008), but not in controls (B = 0.06, SD = 0.01, p = .636), and that this relationship was stable from middle childhood to adulthood. In the second study, we expanded the scope of investigation from family functioning to cumulative environmental risk, referring to the assessment of multiple risk factors in families, and mental health service utilization. Results from moderated mediation analyses revealed that the OAD were more likely to seek out more intensive mental health services as adults than controls (CI = [0.01, 0.15]), as a function of their cumulative environmental risk and subsequent significant mental health need. Study 3 examined whether a preventative intervention to improve family functioning in OAD might improve offspring’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms through changes in parenting stress. In this study, we compared the offspring of a parent having bipolar disorder (OBD), who underwent the Reducing Unwanted Stress in the Home (RUSH) intervention program, with control offspring. Designed as a quasi-experiment, in which the control group underwent an assessment-only condition, families of both groups completed assessments pre- and post-intervention, as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Mixed-modelling analyses revealed that improvements in parenting stress mediated the relationship between participation in the RUSH program and reduced offspring internalizing and externalizing symptoms at a six-month follow-up. Taken together, the results show that the OAD may be especially sensitive to stress in the rearing environment as compared to offspring of parents with no affective disorders. Adversity and dysfunction in the home environment might be a particularly salient risk factor for OAD, leading to the development of emotional and behavioural problems, as well as costly mental health interventions. Interventions aimed at improving the rearing environment during childhood may therefore improve developmental outcomes in the OAD and decrease the cost-of-care for these high risk families, as evidenced by the findings of this thesis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, fundamentally transforming industries and societies through unprecedented automation and data-driven applications. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterized by a fusion of software and hardware improvements, creating a seamless blend of the physical, digital, and biological spheres. These improvements make it possible for AI to leverage and process vast amounts of information to generate actionable insights, and perform complex tasks more quickly and more accurately than humans, leading to more informed decisions and efficient processes.

Despite its success and promising results in other domains, the adoption and integration of AI innovations in healthcare has been complex and slow. Few AI innovations have met with success and have been incorporated into daily practice. This thesis addresses technological, legal and ethical issues that must be mitigated before AI-based systems can be fully adopted and trusted into clinical trials and workflows. We  identify an opportunity to further the state-of-the-art of AI solutions and their adoption in healthcare through privacy-preserving aggregation algorithms and human-centered evaluations of transparency in clinical decision support systems.  


In particular, this dissertation explores advanced methodologies in Federated Learning (FL) for improving collaborative learning, data privacy, and decision-making across various domains. We improve the core FL aggregation algorithm for better handling the learning of distributed heterogeneous data sources, with a method named Precision-weighted Federated Learning. We perform extensive evaluations with benchmark datasets on resource-constrained environments to measure its limits and perform additional tests on clinical data to enhance the quality of clinical assessment analysis, validating its utility.  

Our research also aims to understand how to visualize AI model outputs to enhance transparency in clinical decision support systems. We conduct extensive evaluations to assess the impact of visualizing AI uncertainty and personal traits on decision-making, supporting the design of AI outputs that are interpretable by clinicians. Initially, we explore the effects in low-risk gaming scenarios, followed by an examination of AI uncertainty representation in high-stakes clinical decision-making, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease prognosis.

In summary, this dissertation presents significant advancements in FL and clinical decision support systems. We address some of the current limitations and challenges of adopting AI systems, and demonstrate improvements in collaborative learning, data privacy, and human-AI decision-making. These findings offer valuable insights for designing robust, efficient, and trustworthy AI and FL systems. We believe that user-centered design practices will eventually play a more prominent role in the development of AI tools and technologies, becoming the driving force behind moving innovations from the laboratory to the clinic.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Multimethod Approach to Resilience Against Alcohol Use, Depression, and Suicide among Indigenous Youth in a Northern Quebec Community</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Reynolds, Ashley</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Colonization, historical loss and intergenerational trauma have given rise to mental health disparities among Indigenous communities. For over 100 years, assimilation policies have directly targeted Indigenous youth. While many Indigenous youth have thrived despite the experience of intergenerational trauma and ongoing colonization, problems with alcohol use, depression, and suicide risk continue to be reported. Yet, little research has looked at the temporal sequence of these mental health problems among Indigenous youth. In turn, interventions have often been based off of research among non-Indigenous youth, which have been limited at best. In turn, there is a need to return to Indigenous ways of knowing in order to promote the well-being of Indigenous youth. Using quantitative (Study 1) and qualitative (Study 2) studies, the goal of this dissertation was to develop a community-specific model of alcohol use, depressive symptoms, and suicide resilience among Indigenous youth in one Northern Quebec community. Study 1 (N=110) utilized a longitudinal design to examine change in alcohol use and negative affect (a symptoms of depression) and reciprocal associations in a sample of Indigenous youth. Results demonstrated that when an Indigenous adolescent drank more alcohol than expected at one time point, they reported higher levels of negative affect than expected at the following assessment. This may suggest that drinking alcohol precedes negative affect. Study 2 (N=14) utilized semi-structured interviews with community members to understand alcohol and suicide resilience from an Indigenous perspective. Through the voices of Indigenous people in the community, colonization was identified as the primary problem that led to alcohol use and suicide risk. Complementary to Study 1, most of the participants highlighted that drinking alcohol precedes suicidal ideations and behaviours. Connecting as a community and returning to living off of the land is where the participants believed recovery would be found. Taken together, both studies shed light on understanding alcohol use, negative affect and suicidality rooted in systemic factors and a continued call for supporting Indigenous peoples in revitalizing their cultures.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Study of Roof-Mounted Vertical Axis Wind Turbines in Different Environments</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rezaei, Farshad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine, CFD, RANS, Roof-top, Mars, Winglet, Dome</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>The need for sustainable energy solutions is more pressing than ever, and wind energy presents a promising option. Among various wind turbine designs, the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) stands out due to its efficiency in low-wind conditions and its ability to capture wind from any direction. This study utilizes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to explore the potential benefits of installing VAWTs on roof-tops of buildings. By employing CFD simulations, we analyze the efficiency and performance improvements achievable through strategic placement of VAWTs in urban environments. 
Placing VAWTs on building roof-tops is significant for harnessing local wind energy and reducing the costs and losses associated with power transmission. By integrating wind turbines directly into the building structure, energy can be generated on-site, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Our findings indicate that a VAWT installed on a 30.48 m (100 ft) building roof-top can achieve up to a 36% increase in maximum power output, compared to the uniform flow. For taller buildings, this increase can reach up to 84%, demonstrating the substantial impact of building height on wind energy capture.
The study further investigates the placement of VAWTs at various positions on roof-tops and examines the effects of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) on performance. Results reveal that the power coefficient (CP) of VAWTs can reach 0.487 in minimally obstructed coastal areas but decreases with increased terrain roughness. Additionally, positioning a VAWT on a dome structure, compared to a cubic building of equal height, results in a significant 50.7% increase in the maximum CP. This variation underscores the importance of building shape and placement in optimizing wind energy capture. 
Establishing a human presence on Mars may be a possibility in the next few decades. In such a scenario, energy production is crucial. Domes are likely to be the preferred living structures on Mars, offering stability and protection against the planet harsh conditions. Positioning VAWTs atop these domes can effectively capture Martian winds, providing a sustainable and reliable energy source for the inhabitants. Winglets on the VAWTs improve aerodynamic efficiency by mitigating tip vortices, leading to a CP increase of up to 35.8% compared to uniform flow in the Martian atmosphere at optimal Tip Speed Ratios (TSRs). Furthermore, placing the VAWT on a dome enhances performance by accelerating incoming flow and reducing vortex formation, achieving a CP increase of 53.9% at peak performance, compared to uniform flow.
Placing VAWTs on roof-tops significantly boosts power extraction, with increases in energy output for taller buildings. The strategic positioning of VAWTs, particularly on domes and at various roof-top locations, proves essential for optimizing wind energy capture. The findings underscore the potential for VAWTs to enhance energy efficiency both in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments, paving the way for more sustainable energy solutions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Three Essays on Ownership Structure</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ronagh, Saman</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Ownership structure, capital structure, organization capital, IPO, convertible preferred equity</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines three topics in ownership structure. In the first essay, we document a convex relationship between leverage and ownership of a firm’s largest individual blockholder. This convex influence of ownership on leverage is largely driven by the bankruptcy risk. Ownership has a concave impact on leverage through the threat of the market for corporate control and blockholder’s empire building desires. Further, we show that the ownership-leverage relationship differs depending on the blockholder’s identity (from a convex one for family firms to a concave one for non-family insider firms). Our results are robust to controlling for the endogeneity of ownership and alternative definitions of leverage.
In the second essay, we investigate the timing and determinants of investment in organization capital (OC). Using a comprehensive sample of U.S. IPOs, we document a significant decline in the investment in OC after going public. This decline is positively related to the dilution of the largest individual blockholders (a proxy for change in agency problems) and negatively related to IPO offer size (a proxy for access to capital). We also find that OC investment is positively related to family ownership and negatively related to venture capitalist presence, possibly because of their different investment horizon. 
In the third essay, we examine the prevalence and importance of voting convertible preferred equity (CPE) in a comprehensive sample of US firms and find that around a half of CPE is voting and around seven percent have additional board election rights. In firms with voting CPE, holders of such shares control, on average, around 20% of votes (both on general corporate matters and on board elections). In firms with additional board control rights, CPE holders can elect more than a third of the board. We also investigate the determinants of the voting rights held by CPE holders and find that they are negatively related to individual common blockholder ownership and positively related to a firm's financial distress. We further show that additional board election rights have a positive impact on a firm’s survival. This positive influence is primarily driven by private equity firms as the largest CPE holder.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis is a historical examination of the multi-layered processes of memory transmission in post-Troubles Northern Ireland. The focus is primarily Ardoyne, a working-class and traditionally Catholic Nationalist Republican enclave in North Belfast, segregated along sectarian lines from the Protestant Unionist Loyalist community of Woodvale. Ardoyne has historically experienced the divisions, sectarian violence, death, and displacement during the Troubles, and it has more recently experienced the ambivalent implications of “peace.” To understand these enduring histories, this thesis centres on forty oral history interviews with members of the Ardoyne, Greater Shankill and also Rathcoole and Ballynafeigh communities to examine how we remember, how memory is communicated, and finally, how memory is transmitted to the ceasefire generations. 
Building on the theoretical insights of historians, memory studies scholars and oral historians, this thesis analyses the specific contours of conflict memory by considering the voices of the “ceasefire generation” in conversation with the voices of older generations who directly experienced widespread violence. To hear these voices together illuminates the everyday mechanisms of memory transmission and the subsequent outcomes on issues of culture, belonging, and identity as they have transformed since the conflict. 
Applying the methodology of oral history to examine and engage with emotions and senses in the process of remembering, this thesis pushes the boundaries of Troubles-related knowledge further by considering how fear, anxiety, and loss can shape the type of stories told, or not told. Through an examination of place, commemoration, private memories, cultural histories and identity, the connections between the past and present are illuminated in the go-along interviews. The shadow of the unresolved past casts itself over the present as living memory in the historical context of violence and division. The stories elicited from the oral history interviews highlight the normalisation of conflict and bring some of those stories to light. The thesis presents hopeful conclusions on the role of the ceasefire generation as political actors and the role they will continue to play in shaping the future of Northern Ireland through an engagement and consideration of the past whilst continuing to move forward as memory activists.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effect of Sentiment, Media Mentions and Covid-19 Closures on Investor Behavior</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rouhghalandari, Ali</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The thesis comprises three essays exploring distinct aspects of market behavior influenced by external factors. The first essay studied the sentiment indexes' impact on insider trading behaviors, revealing insiders' propensity to trade against firm-specific sentiment. Notably, insiders strategically time their trades in a contrarian manner, especially concerning factors like R&amp;D intensity and litigation risks around earnings announcements. As expected, statistically and economically insignificant associations of the sentiment proxies are found with both paper and actual dollar profits of round-trip transactions. The findings are cautiously interpreted as being consistent with the litigation-risk management of insiders by timing their trades contrarian to firm-specific sentiment and by not realizing paper profits over horizons of up to one year.
In the second essay, the focus shifts to analyzing the influence of media, particularly the Mad Money TV show, on investor attention and trading activities. The show's recommendations significantly affect institutional and retail investor attention, subsequently influencing trading volumes, short sales activities, and portfolio adjustments. The findings underscore the short-term price pressures driven by noise traders and the impact of media influencers on investor behavior and market dynamics.
The third essay explores the impact of daycare and school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic on OTC investors' trading activities. The study reveals a significant negative association between closures and local firms' trading activities, particularly affecting smaller firms with lower institutional ownership and limited geographic dispersion. This adverse effect is attributed to pandemic-induced attention diversion among local investors with children, highlighting the interconnectedness between socio-economic factors and market behaviors during unprecedented events.
Overall, these essays contribute valuable insights into understanding how sentiment indexes, media influencers like TV shows, and external socio-economic factors such as pandemic-related closures can shape investor behaviors and market outcomes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Associations between blood pressure and sleep: A comprehensive examination of pediatric blood pressure measurement and objective sleep dimensions</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rowe, Hillary</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Hypertension is a significant public health concern in both adult and pediatric populations. With increasing prevalence of hypertension, there is growing emphasis on identifying risk factors for high blood pressure. Poor sleep has emerged as a significant predictor of hypertensive status. In particular, short sleep duration has been widely studied as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. There is evidence that other dimensions of sleep, such as sleep disruption or timing, may influence blood pressure, but relatively few studies examine these associations. The objective of the present dissertation was to examine associations between blood pressure and specific sleep dimensions. Study 1 consisted of a scoping review of pediatric ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) measurement practices and meta-analysis of diurnal variation in pediatric blood pressure. Studies showed moderate fidelity to current measurement standards, but there was significant variability in data reporting. Youth showed pronounced diurnal variation in blood pressure, supported by significant differences in day and night blood pressure. Study 2 was a meta-analysis examining associations between casual blood pressure (i.e., in-office recording) and the following sleep dimensions in children and adults: sleep duration, awakenings, sleep efficiency, sleep irregularity, and sleep stages. Higher blood pressure was associated with shorter sleep duration, more frequent awakenings, and poorer overall sleep. There was evidence of changes across age, with older samples showing stronger associations between blood pressure and sleep. Study 3 examined associations between casual blood pressure and objectively measured sleep dimensions (i.e., actigraphy, polysomnography) in a community sample of children. Higher blood pressure was significantly associated with shorter sleep duration, later bedtime, more frequent arousals (i.e., sleep disruption), and less time spent in restorative sleep stages. Overall, findings from this dissertation indicate that blood pressure is associated with multiple dimensions of sleep from early in the lifespan. Further research is needed to examine how these associations progress over time in order to develop effective prevention and interventions for hypertension.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Politics of Devotion: Material Culture and Lived Religion in a Bengali Guru-Shrine</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Roy, Purna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation examines the intersections of material culture, lived religion, and nationalism at Belūr Maṭh, a guru-devotional site in Bengal and the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission, a transnational religious institution. Established in 1898 by Swami Vivekananda, Belūr Maṭh is popularly viewed as a cultural-religious symbol of Bengal and a prominent guru-devotional shrine visited by both devotees and tourists. The study examines the materiality of the site – the iconographic images of the saints, sacred food, and the built materiality – paying attention to how these items are presented by the monks of the institution and how the devotees encounter them. In analysing the iconographic representations of the saints, I show how discourses of gender and nationalism are embedded within the images, influenced by the ideological constructs of the anti-colonial movement centered in Bengal. Moving to the post-colonial contemporary period, I highlight two major changes in the materiality of the maṭh: alterations to the sacred food menu distributed to the public and a reconfiguration of the built materiality of the maṭh, with new facilities such as toilet blocks, drinking-water taps, amenities accompanied by signage acknowledging the patrons – the central government of India. In examining the material practices of the maṭh, this research elucidates the ways in which nationalist rhetoric are disseminated within religious communities, shaping collective identities. The study also sheds light on the everyday lay devotees and visitors who come to the temple complex, and through fieldwork methods of participant observation and interviews, illustrate their encounters with the materiality of the site. I demonstrate how encounters with the saints’ iconography, relics, and sacred food believed to be imbued with their divine power, facilitate bonds with the saints, and in the process, shape religious identity. By analysing the devotees’ responses through the lens of nationalism, I demonstrate how “banal nationalism” is constructed and shaped through everyday religiosity, surreptitiously seeping into the everyday public sphere. Overall, the study investigates the maṭh as a lived religious site, where religious specialists, lay devotees, (deified) saints, and political government figures form networks of relationships shaped by various factors.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Freeze-Thaw Damage Assessment of Internally Insulated Historic Brick Masonry Walls Under Canada’s Future Climates</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sahyoun, Sahar</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Canada has taken steps to address climate change and protect heritage buildings by setting energy reduction targets and ensuring occupant comfort. Whereas internal insulation systems have emerged as a potential strategy to address these challenges, the use of such systems may also increase the risk to freeze-thaw (FT) damage of the exterior wall assembly and thereby lead to long-term deterioration of historic brick walls due to reduced drying capacity. Current standards provide general heritage preservation advice, but more specific technical guidance is needed to enhance thermal performance, ensure wall durability with interior insulation, and address climate change impacts on the masonry system. The information provided in this study is to contribute to the existing body of knowledge related to the long-term performance of historic masonry walls, by examining the FT damage of internally insulated historic brick masonry walls under a changing climate. In this study, recommendations are provided for optimal insulation selection to minimize freeze-thaw damage. 
Typically, a 30-year period is recommended to evaluate the long-term effects of climate change on building envelopes. However, an alternative approach is to select a single moisture reference year (MRY) that can accurately assess moisture stress over time, reducing the time and costs of simulations with multiple climate parameters. This study assessed the reliability of of presently used climate-based indices for selecting an MRY to evaluate the risk to FT damage in internally insulated brick walls. Finding the existing methods inadequate, the study proposed an alternative approach based on hygrothermal simulations. 
A parametric analysis was thereafter conducted to identify the key factors influencing FT damage in brick masonry walls. Simulations were conducted over a continuous 31-year period, as well as for each separate year, demonstrating no cumulative impact on annual FT cycles. The study determined that MRYs at the 93rd percentile severity could be employed for evaluating FT in retrofitting design decision-making.
By examining potential FT damage under different future climatic conditions and considering various factors, this research offers a decision-making process for internal insulation retrofit projects and proposes solutions when significant risk of FT deterioration is expected.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Occupancy Monitoring and Pattern Analysis for Urban Building Energy Modeling</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Samareh Abolhassani, Soroush</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Urban Building Energy Modeling, occupancy monitoring, WiFi sensing technology, occupant behavior</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>One of the main required actions for moving forward in zero-carbon cities’ goals is to increase building energy efficiency. Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) can help optimize the built environment's energy efficiency and improve the design and operation of building energy systems. Moreover, building modeling provides key information for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control, building energy management, different building energy efficiency scenarios, and feedback to the occupants. In order to parametrize Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM), individual buildings' characteristics, such as constructions, internal loads, energy systems, etc., are required. Many dynamic UBEMs have already been developed, yet most use simplified assumptions for some of the parameters needed. The capabilities required for having a comprehensive UBEM are creating detailed 3D urban building geometry, creating a comprehensive building attributes library, conducting detailed archetype selection, and assignment of this construction information to the building surfaces. More importantly, occupant behavior is another important factor that influences the modeling results, and it is the root of high uncertainty in UBEM results. Most existing tools have a significant weakness in dealing with occupant related monitoring data or estimation of likely schedules. 
Many studies have been conducted to develop and introduce different occupant behavior measurements and methods for urban building energy modeling. However, none of the previous studies introduced scalable and practical occupant behavior monitoring on an urban scale. Some of the main challenges that prevent the scalability of the already developed occupant behavior methods and measurements are the fact that they suffer from threatening the occupant's privacy and the high cost of their infrastructure and deployment. 
This thesis aims to leverage passive WiFi sensing methods for occupant behavior monitoring and pattern analysis for UBEM using commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices, for which the infrastructure is already available in many buildings. Passive and device-free WiFi sensing does not threaten the occupant's privacy, and its deployment cost is low. Therefore, this method of occupancy measurement has the potential to be used on an urban scale and to play an essential role to manage energy in zero carbon and smart cities in the future.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has seen a significant rise in recent years, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create greener cities. This has led to the development of a new EV charging ecosystem, composed of both physical and cyber systems. The physical layer consists of high-wattage IoT charging equipment and the power grid, while the cyber layer provides access and flexibility.

As the EV ecosystem has advanced, securing it has become crucial due to its critical role in providing essential services. The inter-connectivity of charging equipment and the lack of standardization make the system an attractive target for cyber attacks, with the potential to disrupt and destabilize the power grid. Khaled Sarieddine's research contributions aim to address these security challenges. The thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the EV ecosystem, starting with a detailed literature review and the creation of a real-time co-simulation testbed that includes both cyber and physical layer components. The research develops an advanced fingerprinting technique to identify EV charging stations (EVCSs) in the wild and investigates the malware threat landscape, discovering Mirai-infected EVCSs. It also examines mobile applications as a potential attack vector against the power grid, identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited to initiate unlawful charging sessions. Furthermore, the research assesses the security of OCPP backends worldwide, uncovering 6 zero-day vulnerabilities in each of 16 vendors studied. These vulnerabilities impact the infrastructure's confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad). To mitigate the limitations of centralized detection algorithms, the research develops an edge-based detection mechanism to identify oscillatory load attacks that leverage both physical and cyber layer features. By addressing these security challenges, this research contributes to the development of a more secure and resilient EV charging ecosystem, ensuring the reliable and safe provision of essential services to individuals and businesses.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Seismic analysis of concrete gravity dams using a novel time domain spectral finite element method</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sarkar, Avirup</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis introduces a two-dimensional spectral finite element formulation tailored for the dynamic analysis of concrete gravity dams. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely utilized for dynamic structural analysis, its application to large structures often demands substantial computational resources and time. To address this challenge, alternative modelling techniques known as Spectral Finite Element Methods (SFEMs) have been developed over the past decades to enhance computational efficiency.
The objective of this thesis is to develop a computationally efficient analysis procedure for dynamic analysis of large structures like concrete gravity dams and then apply the developed procedure for assessing the behaviour of dams subjected to seismic ground motions as well as deterioration effects like alkali-aggregate reactions. 
The Time Domain-based SFEM (TDSFEM) was chosen for dynamic time history analysis of concrete gravity dams due to its advantages over the Frequency Domain-based SFEM (FDSFEM). TDSFEM is particularly effective in handling irregular geometries and finite domains, making it a better choice for complex structural analyses. Sensitivity analyses and convergence studies were conducted using both 4-noded and 9-noded elements, revealing TDSFEM’s superior computational efficiency, especially when higher-order elements are employed.
Comparative studies between TDSFEM and conventional FEM highlighted TDSFEM's advantage in reducing computational time while maintaining accuracy in large-scale dynamic analyses. Modal analysis and time history analysis indicated that TDSFEM, when used with higher-order elements, could be a practical alternative to conventional FEM, offering substantial time savings without sacrificing precision.
The study also investigated damage detection methods based on modal parameters, including displacement, curvature, and strain energy. Among these, modal strain energy emerged as the most effective and reliable indicator for identifying and localizing damage. Additionally, TDSFEM was applied to model the behaviour and failure modes of FRP-reinforced concrete deep beams, with results closely matching experimental data, further demonstrating its efficiency.
Moreover, the thesis introduced a simplified thermo-mechanical approach for modelling deterioration effects, such as alkali-aggregate reactions (AAR), providing a novel alternative to existing chemical reaction-based models. TDSFEM is thus presented as a viable, efficient method for analysing large structures, offering significant time savings and effective applications in damage detection and deterioration modelling.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Dynamic Properties of Bimodal Polyethylene: Crystallization and Flow Instabilities</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The emergence of new single-reactor technologies has enabled the production of bimodal polyethylene at reduced capital costs, prompting a need for deeper investigations into the characterization and property-structure relationships of these materials. In this thesis, we are looking at how the molecular structure affects both the solid-state and the melt-state properties of polyethylene.
This study employs a material set featuring systematic variations in molecular weight distribution and short chain branching distribution. The initial step involves extracting the fundamental molecular parameters of the materials by utilizing statistical modelling to acquire the ethylene sequence length distribution and its features. Subsequently, we identify the key parameters governing our materials’ environmental stress crack resistance, a crucial concern, particularly for solid-state properties in pipe applications of bimodal polyethylene. We showed that many mechanical properties from strain hardening tests correlate with features of ethylene sequence length distribution, showing that this distribution is the most meaningful in describing the structure of bimodal polyethylene in terms of solid-state properties. An approach to studying the critical correlations between structure, crystallization, and mechanical properties is presented.
In the latter part of this study, we investigate the effect of molecular weight distribution on the wall-slip behavior of bimodal polyethylene melt under simple shear. The study under simple shear is important as it eliminates the confounding effects of pressure and shear rate gradient. We examine the impact of low molecular weight content on various slip regimes. We showed that the stress level at which the slip velocity becomes independent of molecular weight distribution decreases with an increase in short-chain content. The degree of entanglement between the interfacial and bulk chains drops sharply in the transition region based on the friction of coefficient investigations. 
Throughout our investigations, we frequently observe melt rupture in our materials, prompting further exploration of this instability using visualization techniques. Melt rupture is critical as it limits the industrial applications of these materials. We showed that melt rupture is a time-dependent phenomenon that can occur after a stress and slip velocity plateau is reached, inviting additional studies on the effects of interfacial structural changes during slip.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Due to the growing threat of climate change, the world’s governments have been encouraging the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs). Thus, EV numbers have been growing exponentially and gaining a significant market share. As a result, EV Charging Stations (EVCSs) are being rapidly deployed to satisfy the rising charging demand. These EVCSs are connected to a complex and interconnected system of cyber and physical components. However, without proper security in place, the EV charging load can become a weapon yielded by adversaries to destabilize the power grid. To this end, this thesis examines the security of the EV ecosystem and the impact of EV-based attacks against the grid. The thesis starts by examining the different components and technologies of the EV ecosystem before examining their vulnerabilities. We then demonstrate the greater impact that EV-based attacks can have on the grid as compared to traditional high-wattage smart loads attributed to their bi-directional power flow capabilities and their non-linear nature. We then propose a novel dynamic Load altering (LA) attack strategy that takes advantage of feed-back control theory to induce large frequency instabilities on the grid. To address the serious consequences of such attacks, two district detection methods are devised. The first is a two-tiered detector tailored specifically to be deployed on the EV ecosystem’s Central Management System (CMS) and EVCSs to detect attacks emanating from the EV ecosystem. The second method is a detection scheme from the perspective of the utility aimed at detecting all kinds of LA attacks against the grid. This detector utilizes the grid’s mathematical model to preprocess the collected data and feed it to a Feature Fusion Neural Network (FFNN) that achieves 99.9 % detection accuracy while remaining robust against data poisoning. Finally, we show case the potential strength EVs can introduce into the grid once secured, by developing a robust LA attack mitigation scheme. This mitigation scheme utilizes the EV loads/injections to mitigate the impact of the three types of LA attacks. Additionally, we mathematically model the possible real-life uncertainties that hinder the operation of this mitigation scheme to achieve a robust performance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation appropriates the term “synesthesia” from the neurological condition synesthesia, wherein the stimulation of one sense results in the stimulation of another sense. In this study synesthesia is referenced in the proposed terminology “plastic synesthesia,” a term used to define multisensorial contemporary artworks and stretch the neurological definition of the condition to encompass the concept of sensory “layering.” The concept of “layering” refers to the multiple senses induced by the case studies that are felt at the same time. Plastic synesthesia is also used to define the non-ocularcentric methodology demonstrated in this study. As a methodology, plastic synesthesia identifies the senses and affects involved in multisensory artworks to emphasize how the senses are layered to produce embodied and immersive experiences that augment the “visual” art experience. 
This study posits that plastic synesthetic artworks draw attention to the multisensorial nature of perception distorted by the ocularcentric and sensorially segregated model established in the modern period. This point is demonstrated first with an analysis of Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto’s sculptures, which stimulate the “lower” senses of touch and smell to facilitate an immersive art experience. It also examines Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson’s pieces that use non-art materials to produce multisensory atmospheres. Finally, this dissertation analyzes London-based design group Flying Object’s 2015 multisensory installation Tate Sensorium, Tate Britain, London, which layers visual artworks with non-visual stimuli. In utilizing these two iterations of plastic synesthesia in this dissertation, this study demonstrates an approach to analyzing artworks that considers all of the senses.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Flexural and Shear Behaviour of Fibre-Reinforced Concrete Beams
 Reinforced with GFRP Bars</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shabani Attar, Hamed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Fiber-reinforced concrete; Synthetic fibers; Glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars; Deflection; Serviceability; Shear Capacity; GFRP stirrups</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Due to the lower elastic modulus and higher tensile strength of glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars compared to steel, the design of GFRP-reinforced concrete (RC) flexural members is governed by serviceability limit states, including deflection and crack width. This study enhances understanding of the flexural and shear behaviour of concrete beams reinforced with GFRP bars through experimental and analytical work. The main objective is to elucidate the effect of GFRP bars and fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) on the flexural and shear response of concrete beams. This investigation evaluates existing design equations in North American standards, offering design recommendations for GFRP-FRC beams.
Accordingly, this research is divided into two main phases. Phase I, “Flexural and Serviceability Behaviour of GFRP-FRC Beams”, examines the impact of macro-synthetic fibres on the behaviour of 11 GFRP-RC beams. The study investigates the deflection equations outlined in the CSA S806-12 and ACI 440.11-22 standards, alongside assessing flexural capacity in accordance with ACI 544.4R-18. Furthermore, digital image correlation (DIC) was utilized to capture the crack propagation, crack width, and deflection up to failure, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional contact instrumentations such as linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs) and potentiometers.
Phase II, titled “Shear Behaviour of GFRP-RC Beams”, utilizing 15 specimens, explores parameters including reinforcement ratio, stirrup type, stirrup reinforcement ratio, shear span to depth ratio, and fibre content. The study aims to establish the influence of these parameters on shear capacity, failure mode, and strain variation of stirrup and longitudinal rebar. The results indicated that ACI 440.11-22 and CSA S806-12 strain limits for GFRP stirrups are conservative, and a modified equation is proposed. Current GFRP design codes do not consider the effect of fibres on the shear capacity of GFRP-RC beams. Moreover, the design standard ACI 544.4R-18 for fibre-reinforced concrete, developed for members with steel reinforcement, tends to overestimate the shear capacity of FRP-FRC beams. An experimental database was utilized to assess the accuracy of GFRP design code provisions in determining the shear capacity of GFRP-RC beams. A modified equation is proposed to incorporate the effect of macro-synthetic fibres, validated through literature and current tested specimens.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores advanced spatiotemporal machine learning techniques for traffic and hydrometric prediction using graph-based neural network models, RNN family, attention mechanism, and transformer architecture. First, a multilevel GNN-RNN architecture is proposed for traffic forecasting, effectively capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies across urban road networks. This model significantly reduces computation time and improves prediction accuracy compared to existing methods. In the domain of hydrometric forecasting, a spatiotemporal model with an attention-augmented Graph Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (GCRN) is introduced. This model learns the connectivity between water stations adaptively through a graph learning module, addressing the dynamic nature of water systems. Additionally, a flood prediction model, LocalFloodNet, combines GNNs with a digital twin simulation tool, enabling interactive flood scenario analysis and prevention strategies. The model was applied to a case study for the city of Terrebonne. Finally, a hybrid model integrating Vision Transformers (ViTs) and LiDAR terrain data is developed for long-term hydrometric prediction, utilizing both static terrain features and dynamic temporal relationships. These models collectively enhance forecasting capabilities across multiple domains, providing more accurate and efficient solutions for traffic and hydrometric challenges.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Mapping the Invisible City: Revealing the Intangible Heritage of Parc-Extension through Narrative Cartography</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shahamati, Sepideh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Urban heritage includes tangible features such as buildings and infrastructure as well as the intangible: the feelings, memories, and stories associated with places that can be considered the soul of the city. In this research, I aim to reveal this intangible heritage by mapping the constellation of stories and memories that contribute to the production of places. To do so, I studied one neighborhood in Montreal: Parc-Extension, a multi-cultural low-income neighborhood that is facing a serious loss of its intangible heritage due to a rapid gentrification process. To better understand what intangible heritage means in Parc-Extension, I engaged with local community groups, I walked in the area following auto-ethnography practices, and I conducted 19 oral history interviews with former and current residents of the neighborhood focusing on their memories and stories about this place. I then mapped these interviews with an online narrative cartography tool, Atlascine, specifically designed to combine the visual and navigational power of maps with the emotional and personal dimensions of stories. The Atlas of Intangible Heritage of Parc-Extension provides access to these stories, to the places and events of importance, and to the memories associated with them.
Through this process, I was able to look more closely at some of the characteristics of intangible heritage in Parc-Extension. First, this research demonstrates that intangible heritage is a dynamic notion that keeps evolving over time with residents and with their experiences and memories. It is not only about romanticizing the past but also about its connection with present-day issues, including gentrification and displacement. Secondly, intangible heritage is often deeply intertwined with tangible places such as schools, parks, buildings, and houses that remain spatio-temporal anchors to these stories and memories. Thirdly, the importance of memories, stories, and the places associated with them vary between individuals and across socio-demographic groups. Therefore, to approach intangible heritage in a meaningful way, we need to constantly engage with personal and collective stories told by those whose voices are rarely heard. This involves opening a space for these stories to be shared, listened to, and made accessible. This is what has been done in this research, which ends with an audio walk. This guided tour curates the past and present stories of the residents of Parc-Extension while inviting its listeners to walk and experience the neighborhood. It emphasizes the importance of being physically present in a place to grasp some of its intangible heritage.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>digitized dyadic services: the impact of technology on interpersonal services</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shamayleh, Ghalia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The technological advancements connecting service providers with consumers have facilitated the digitization of several markets. In this research, I study how the interactions between service providers and clients are shaped by the digitization of a dyadic service experience traditionally delivered and consumed in person. Consumer research has studied online consumer interactions as technological advancements have shifted our consumption activities toward the digital realm. Specific to technologically reassembled collective practices, consumer research has focused on interactions between consumers with established personal relationships. However, the extant literature does not explain the dynamics of technologically mediated interactions between interpersonal service providers and clients. I ask: how does digitization impact the dynamics of interaction between service provider and client throughout the interpersonal service experience? My data consists of 26 in-depth interviews with therapists and therapy clients and 63 podcast episodes with psychotherapists discussing the impacts of digitization on therapy. Through interpretive analysis of this data, I theorize how to conduct dyadic transformative services by realizing affordances within a hybrid service landscape consisting of the spatial and digital arrangements of service provider and client. I also showcase how connective labor is performed in digitized services where the reduced visibility of body language cues hinders its delivery. I adopt microsociology and interaction ritual theory as theoretical lenses to understand how technological mediation reshapes the interaction dynamics between interpersonal service providers and clients. To account for the digital landscape through which the online dyadic service occurs, I apply affordance theory as an enabling lens to analyze my findings. My findings extend interaction ritual theory by theorizing how both service providers and clients are responsibilized within the hybrid service landscape to reach a successful interaction ritual. My research contributes theoretically by (1) developing a framework showcasing how digitized transformative services are performed via connective labor and maintained by responsibilizing both consumer and service provider, and (2) conceptualizing the connective space as the outcome of successful digitized interactions. My findings are also relevant to practitioners and managers who offer digitized dyadic services or develop the platforms through which commercial or personal interactions are mediated, respectively.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Automated Progress Monitoring and Reporting for Construction Projects</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>In complex and dynamic construction sites, efficient progress monitoring and reporting play an important role in minimizing schedule delays and cost overruns. Such reporting requires detailed and accurate records from job sites to help project managers in comparing project’s current state to its as-planned state. Manual traditional progress reporting is time-consuming, costly, labour-intensive, and error-prone. In recent years, advancements in technologies and methods have been introduced in an effort to overcome the challenges of manual methods and to automate the processes of progress monitoring and reporting. These introduced levels of automation still lack capabilities to provide complete and accurate information about the project’s current status and available resources on job sites. To address these challenges, this thesis introduces a novel framework for automated progress reporting in construction. This framework provides detailed information for each tracked building element, enabling the identification of its current status and the generation of timely progress reports. The developments integrated into the framework focus on challenges associated with congested mechanical components in indoor environments. Monitoring these components is crucial because their complex and time-consuming installation procedures can lead to project delays.
The developed framework consists of three main modules: (i) Object Recognition (ii) Object Localization, (iii) Integrated Object Recognition and Localization. In the “Object Recognition” module, two deep learning algorithms, YOLACT++ and Mask R-CNN, were utilized in processing digital images captured at construction sites for the automated recognition of tracked building elements. YOLACT++ proved superior to Mask R-CNN and was accordingly utilized in the developed framework. In the “Object Localization” module, a Real-time Locating System (RTLS) is utilized to identify the location of each recognized element along with its ID. The Ultra-wideband (UWB) system was selected as an RTLS, and different laboratory and field experiments were conducted to validate the UWB system’s localization performance. Finally, in the “Integrated Object Recognition and Localization” module, a user-friendly application was developed to integrate the outputs from the YOLACT++ model and the UWB system and automatically generate status reports of tracked elements. These reports include visual and location information, along with the unique ID of each element.
The framework was tested and validated using 3,632 images. The results demonstrate good performance and effectiveness of the developed framework under challenging conditions; yielding recognition accuracy of close to 85% in precision and recall for HVAC duct and slightly less than that for pipes. Similar performance was achieved in localization, yielding errors ranging from 0.03 to 1.22 meters in two-dimensional (2D) coordinates and from 0.15 to 1.6 meters in three-dimensional (3D) coordinates in the field test. The developed framework can be easily extended to other building elements, and the excel format of its output can facilitate linkage with Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Stuck on the Wrong Side of the Tracks: Crime and Neighbourhood Change Across Adulthood</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shanahan Somerville, Mari C.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Moving from a disadvantaged neighbourhood to one of more affluence has been shown to improve life outcomes. However, not everyone manages to overcome the environmental and social hazards of such neighbourhoods. Success may depend on individual differences such as childhood social behaviour, education, and criminal activity. Crime and neighbourhood disadvantage are highly correlated, but the directional nature of this relationship and its transactional nature throughout life have rarely been examined. Part One of the current investigation examined whether individual characteristics, including childhood social behaviour, education, and criminality, contribute to the perpetuation of socioeconomic immobility across adulthood via neighbourhood disadvantage using a growth curve model. In Part Two, the potential transactional nature of associations between crime and disadvantage over time were examined utilizing a cross-lagged analysis. 
Participants were drawn from the Concordia Longitudinal Research Project, a prospective, 47-year longitudinal investigation of over 4000 families from neighbourhoods of low socioeconomic status in Québec, Canada. In Part One, Growth curves modeled differences in change in participants’ neighbourhood disadvantage (via census data) over 30 years, from middle-childhood (age 7-12) to middle-adulthood (age 46-57). Predictors included childhood social behaviours and total criminal charges in early adulthood (age 18-28). In Part Two, to examine potential transactions, cross-lagged associations were modeled between neighbourhood disadvantage across four time points (1976, 1986, 1996, 2006). In this model, childhood neighbourhood disadvantage (1976) and aggression were included as predictors and total years of education was included as a mediator.
Part One results indicated that participants with no criminal charges showed the greatest improvement in neighbourhood over time, whereas those with many charges showed little improvement. Participants with histories of childhood aggression, withdrawal, or lower likeability were also less likely to experience improvements. Results from Part Two indicated that the association between charges and neighbourhood disadvantage was transactional over time and that education may play an important protective role for individuals who grow up in disadvantaged neighbourhoods or for more aggressive children. These findings provide evidence for the importance of criminality in undermining at-risk young adults’ ability to overcome neighbourhood disadvantage, highlighting risk and protective factors that may inform early and long-term intervention and policy.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Simplifying Interpretation of Ultrasound Imaging: Deep Learning Approaches for Phase Aberration Correction and Automatic Segmentation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sharifzadeh, Mostafa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Medical Image Processing, Deep Learning, Ultrasound, Phase Aberration, Segmentation</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Medical ultrasound imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in clinical practice, offering several advantages, including high temporal resolution, non-invasiveness, cost-effectiveness, and portability. Despite these benefits, ultrasound modality often suffers from lower image quality compared to other modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, which complicates image interpretation and poses diagnostic challenges, even for experienced clinicians. Given its unique advantages, simplifying the interpretation of ultrasound images can profoundly impact the accessibility and affordability of healthcare. This thesis aims to enhance the interpretability of ultrasound images using deep learning (DL)-based approaches on two parallel fronts.
The first front focuses on improving image quality by addressing the phase aberration effect, a primary contributor to the degradation of medical ultrasound images. Phase aberration arises from spatial variations in sound speed within heterogeneous media, introducing artifacts such as blurring and geometric distortions. This effect hinders the accurate representation of tissue structures and complicates clinical interpretation. To tackle this, we propose two novel methods. The first involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the aberration profile from the B-mode image and employing it to compensate for the aberration effects. The second introduces an aberration-to-aberration approach combined with an innovative loss function to train a CNN that directly predicts corrected radio frequency data without requiring ground truth.
The second front focuses on the automatic segmentation of ultrasound images and explores the challenges associated with employing DL-based approaches. Manual segmentation, typically performed by expert clinicians, is time-consuming and prone to human error, and automating this process can simplify the interpretation of ultrasound images. While DL methods have demonstrated considerable potential, ultrasound image segmentation poses unique challenges due to artifacts such as shadowing, reverberation, refraction, phase aberration, and speckle noise. The scarcity of medical data further complicates these challenges, limiting the generalizability and robustness of models in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we investigate the shift-variance problem in CNNs and propose pyramidal blur-pooling layers to mitigate this issue. Furthermore, we tackle domain shift and data scarcity by employing a domain adaptation method and introducing an ultra-fast ultrasound image simulation technique based on frequency domain analysis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Machine Learning for Fault Prediction in Clouds</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shayesteh, Behshid</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The vast adoption of cloud computing has increased the size and complexity of data centers, increasing possibility of faults. Fault can negatively impact the performance, availability, and reliability of cloud services, leading to significant maintenance cost and revenue loss for cloud service providers. Therefore, fault prediction in clouds is a critical task. Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used for this purpose due to their pattern recognition capabilities. While predicting faults in clouds using ML enables a proactive approach to prevent faults, building accurate prediction models that can maintain their performance in dynamic clouds is challenging. One problem is concept drift, where changes in data distribution can degrade model performance. Similarly, feature drift, which is changes in feature relevancy, can also degrade the model performance. Additionally, models accuracy is influenced by data-related parameters, necessitating selection of these parameters to achieve a high model performance. Existing ML-based fault prediction solutions do not focus on adaptability to dynamic conditions like concept or feature drift. Additionally, selecting data-related parameters to balance model performance and resource consumption is not addressed in current literature.

This thesis mainly focuses on addressing the challenges of employing ML models for predicting faults and predicting application performance degradation caused by faults in cloud environments. We first propose a concept drift adaptation algorithm for fault prediction in clouds using Reinforcement Learning (RL). This algorithm considers the cloud operator's requirements, and uses RL to select the most appropriate drift adaptation method as well as data size for adaptation that fulfills the requirements. Second, we propose a feature drift adaptation solution for adapting the model to feature drifts while predicting application performance degradation in clouds. This solution consists of a feature drift detector that monitors the performance of the prediction model as well as the feature importance, and a feature drift adaptor that measures the drift severity to adapt the prediction model. Finally, we propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm to select the training data size, data sampling interval, input window, and prediction horizon for training an ML model that predicts application performance degradation in clouds.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Queer occult: How Queer People in Montréal “Reclaim” Practices of Astrology, Tarot, and Magic to Divest from Legacies of Settler Colonialism, Whiteness, and Imperial Modernity</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>occult, queer, biopower, enlightenment, enchantment, affect, empire, settler colonialism, whiteness, queer historicism, astrology, magic, witchcraft, ancestor work, divestment</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Over the past few years there has been an explosion in popularity of so-called ‘occult’ practices like astrology and tarot, particularly among left-leaning people who tend to politicize their investments as forms of counterhegemony. Queer practitioners have claimed kinship with the occult through a perceived shared abjection, deeming it an inherently queer resource for self- and community empowerment, and naming anti-racism and decolonization key aims of their work. At the same time, these forms of occultism draw suspicion, not least among practitioners themselves, who are critical of the ways these knowledge traditions have been complicit in ‘spiritual genocide’. 

In ethnographic fieldwork among queer occultists in Montreal, I explore how practitioners imagine themselves to be divesting from legacies of violence, opting instead for apparently queer genealogies of knowledge that are known in terms of the ways they have been repressed. Drawing from work across history of science, critical race theory, queer studies, and affect theory, I theorize the occult as an historiographic mode, always already about epistemic crisis and the struggle between sanctioned methods of inquiry. I theorize the occult’s appeal among queer people as a process of affective expansion, wherein practitioners attune to heretofore repressed lifeways, knowledges and worlds that machineries of empire have rendered invisible. What's more, I depart from debates over cultural appropriation to develop a theory of the occult as a biopolitical affect regime, wherein the development of sensitivity is linked to social healing and progress. I locate the contemporary phenomenon of queer occultism within a broader conversation on inheritance, historical repair, and divestment from empire, wherein participants confront the possibility of connecting to the "elsewhere" of imperial modernity. How does the occult represent an attempt to build a capacity for that connection, and how do participants reflect on this capacity as key to healing from white supremacy, capitalism, and colonialism?</etd_ms:description>

Boolean Combination of Classifiers</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Software defects can lead to critical failures. Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP) techniques identify potential defects early, improving software reliability and maintainability. This thesis addresses project clusters, data imbalance, and classifier combination challenges for JIT-SDP. The contributions were evaluated using diverse software projects and 34 datasets, totaling 259k commits.

The first contribution introduces ClusterCommit, a JIT-SDP approach tailored for project clusters sharing libraries and functionalities. Unlike traditional methods, ClusterCommit employs a machine learning model trained on commits from various projects within a cluster. The study incorporates six machine learning and three deep learning models. The results reveal noteworthy improvements, with mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) values ranging from 4% to 12%, particularly prominent in complex models such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) when dealing with large clusters. In contrast, simpler models like Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) do not perform as well when applied to clusters of projects. This observed trend extends to deep learning models, where all models experience a performance from 3% to 30% with the ClusterCommit approach, irrespective of cluster size.

The second contribution proposed a One-Class Classification (OCC) approach to tackle the data imbalance challenge in JIT-SDP models. OCC algorithms, such as One-class SVM, Isolation Forest, and One-class k-NN, perform better than binary classifiers in medium to high data imbalance ratios. They achieve mean AUCs of 83%, 81%, and 86% for IOF, OC-k-NN, and OC-SVM, respectively, and require fewer features, reducing computational overhead.

Lastly, the JITBoost is a framework that uses a Boolean Combination of Classifiers to construct robust JIT-SDP models. Three BCC algorithms are investigated. JITBoost achieves superior performance by combining decisions from six traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms, with mean AUCs of 89%, 87%, and 88% for JITBoost-BBC, JITBoost-IBC, and JITBoost-WPIBC, respectively.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In indoor environments, ventilation is essential for diluting or removing contaminants, pathogens, excess heat, and moisture, thereby ensuring a healthy and comfortable space. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical role of ventilation in controlling airborne respiratory infections indoors. During this period, inadequate ventilation systems and improper operations in densely populated public spaces were frequently linked to outbreaks and superspreading events, heightening concerns over indoor exposure risks for occupants. As COVID-19 restrictions begin to relax globally, the focus is transitioning to long-term management strategies for the virus. This transition necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the specific ventilation requirements for various indoor spaces. It is imperative to swiftly and accurately assess ventilation conditions and consistently ensure an adequate supply of clean air. This study focuses on mitigation strategies to reduce indoor exposure risks and prepare for the post-pandemic era. The multizone CONTAM modeling of aerosol transport under different mechanical mitigation strategies was investigated in five DOE prototype buildings. To utilize field evidence for improving indoor air quality, a novel approach integrating Bayesian inference and stochastic CO2 grey-box models was applied. This approach was used to evaluate the ventilation conditions within two primary school classrooms in Montreal. The Equivalent Clean Airflow Rate (ECAi) was calculated following ASHRAE 241, revealing an insufficient clean air supply in both classrooms. To achieve a sufficient ECAi, an additional 0.38 m3/s of clean air delivery rate (CADR) from air-cleaning devices is recommended. Finally, steady-state CO2 thresholds (Climit, Ctarget, and Cideal) were established to indicate when ECAi requirements could be achieved under various mitigation strategies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Showcase Film and American Corporate Promotion at Mid-Century</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Smith, Kyla Rose</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Sponsored films have traditionally been understood in film studies as motion pictures made for utilitarian rather than aesthetic or artistic purposes. Scholarly interventions emphasize production context over textual analysis. As such, general interpretation of “sponsored films” equates them with a utilitarian aesthetic. I propose the showcase film as a new subtype of sponsored motion pictures, a range of aesthetically rich expensive, large-scale productions which emerged in the United States in the period 1955¬–1965 from the context of an American visual culture saturated by the products of two prominent image domains: Hollywood, and the field of corporate promotion, two spheres predicated on display and performance. 
The fluorescence of showcase films in the 10-year period from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s is indicative of both the development of the sponsored film industry and its embeddedness in the communications and promotional processes of corporations. It is also emblematic of corporate America’s growing interest in design and aesthetics to facilitate brand-image creation as the postwar corporation was redefined. By mid-century “design” was established as an important tool in the operations of the modern corporation. In this period, the designer’s concept of visual appeal was central to the promulgation of large-scale promotional media as exemplified by the showcase film.

Like a shop window, these films were designed to present viewers with a compelling view of the sponsor’s brand identity. Previously, scholars have examined sponsored films as tools central to the emerging corporate hegemony, especially via the concept of useful cinema. This dissertation acknowledges this connection as central to their ontology while simultaneously urging reconsideration of the aesthetic aspects of these films as central to this utility. Showcase films are argued to function as sophisticated corporate calling cards in the ecology of corporate media promotion.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Unearthing the Substrata of Images: Archives and Counter-Archives of Extraction in Iran is a research-creation project that engages with the history of photography and film practices of the British controlled oil operations in Iran. My doctoral project examines how photography and film became the two primary cultural tools of the oil company, shaping a totalizing logic of representation around resource extraction, constructing an image regime of oil that worked in tandem with the uneven techno-racial organization of labor production in Iran. This project investigates the media practices of the oil company and their consolidation and centralization into British Petroleum’s (BP) official archives in the present moment as a form of epistemic violence. In doing so, it posits the visual technologies of photography, film, and archives utilized by the BP as embodied technologies of eradication and dispossession that have long narrativized and represented the history of British extractive history and its colonial oil operations in Iran and broader Asia. In my doctoral thesis, I argue that the link between extractivism and technologies of vision is historical, material, and ideological. Once we look at the historical continuum and lounge durée of extractivism from a representational standpoint, visuality, authority, and the archive become inseparable from the political economy of oil. Moreover, this project seeks to examine the archival temporalities and evidentiary aesthetics enmeshed in the ethnographic photography and film practices of the early British colonial explorations of oil in Iran. In conjunction with my scholarly research, my doctoral research-creation project is also a practice-based exploration of these contested archival materials through the production of documentary essay films, photographic collages, and multimedia installations, offering a multidisciplinary approach to examine and reconstruct the visual history of oil and recover untold histories of colonial petromodernity in Iran.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Two Essays on Corporate ESG Disclosure</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Soleimanian, Mohammad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>forward-looking statements; ESG; sustainability accounting; voluntary disclosure; textual analysis; machine learning;board ESG expertise; ESG report usefulness; material ESG topics; ESG disclosure tone; ESG disclosure specificity; ESG disclosure modification; corporate governance.</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation consists of two essays relating to corporate ESG disclosure. The first essay examines the predictive value of forward-looking statements (FLS) in ESG reports issued by U.S. public firms. I predict that the disclosure level and linguistic features of FLS in ESG reports contain information about future ESG performance. To examine this prediction, I collect a sample of ESG reports issued by U.S. public firms from 2000 to 2019. The empirical tests show that a higher disclosure level of FLS and a more positive tone of FLS are associated with lower future ESG performance. I also find that more specific FLS and less boilerplate FLS are associated with higher ESG performance in the future, indicating that higher-quality disclosure signals better future performance. This study advances our understanding of forward-looking information in ESG. All findings are robust to specifications that consider alternative measures. The second essay examines whether board ESG expertise is associated with the usefulness of ESG reports. I posit that board ESG expertise plays a pivotal role in shaping the company’s ESG disclosure, aligning it with firm performance, stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements. To examine this prediction, I collect a sample of ESG reports issued by U.S. public firms from 2002 to 2021. Consistent with my predictions, I find that board ESG expertise is associated with the disclosure of material ESG information, less positive ESG disclosure tone, more specific ESG disclosure, and more year-over-year modifications in ESG reports. Difference-in-differences analysis, falsification tests and lagged regression analysis support the main findings. The results indicate that a board of directors with ESG expertise enhances the usefulness of ESG reports. In both essays, we gain critical insights into the predictive value and usefulness of ESG reports, revealing how the quality and characteristics of forward-looking statements and the presence of board ESG expertise significantly shape the predictive value and usefulness of these disclosures.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Challenges and Barriers Facing Mature Women Entering Higher Education</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sorella, Heather</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>When adult learners decide to return to higher education, whether to seek career opportunities or for personal growth, they often experience challenges. Since the 1970s, mature women who have decided to return to post-secondary education have faced more pronounced obstacles due to the multiplicity of women’s roles, a lack of social support, and the challenges of assimilating into an environment designed for younger, traditional students. This dissertation explores the barriers mature 21st-century women face when returning to post-secondary education. It contributes to the otherwise sparse research on the undervaluing of mature women, providing updated findings on today’s mature female students. The data in this research includes narrative interviews grounded on specific themes and driven by personal conversations with the participants. Due to the recurrent themes described by the participants, a general inductive method was used through a narrative analysis framework. The findings were structured around three main pillars: situational barriers, dispositional barriers, and institutional barriers. The exploration of the situational barriers considered the personal obstacles related to domestic relationships and family obligations. The second pillar’s investigation of the dispositional barriers explicitly focused on the participants’ attitudes and perceptions regarding gender, age, socioeconomic levels, and prior educational experiences. Finally, the consideration of institutional barriers examined the lack of visibility and equity provided by institutions of higher learning to non-traditional, mature female students.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Facets of the Reborn Doll Phenomenon: Non-reproductive Motherhood, Synthetic Relationships, Performance, Community, and Self-care</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>St-Hilaire, Emilie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>dolls;reborn dolls;synthetic relationships</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation begins by addressing some basic questions about the hyper-realistic reborn dolls collected by thousands of women around the world, such as: How are reborns made? Who buys them? What are typical reactions to the dolls? And, beyond these initial questions, I consider the purpose and potential of these dolls as a hobby, and also as something more than a hobby. My second chapter delves into the culture surrounding not just reborn dolls but the whole concept of babies and reproduction in order to situate reborns in relation to motherhood. The connection between reborns and motherhood is not as straightforward as it may seem at first glance. Through the theoretical lens of the ‘good life’ (as described in Lauren Berlant’s Cruel Optimism) I will describe how reborns emerge from pronatalist rêverie but also subvert reproductive optimism by offering an alternative to heteronormative reproduction. From there, Chapter Three examines how reborn dolls (and also sex dolls) provide fulfilling synthetic relationships that produce real emotions. These relationships are therapeutic for many and there is evidence that thousands of people are engaging in synthetic relationships all around the world. I argue for the potential of synthetic relationships to provide outlets for the rehearsal of power significant in the production of self. This chapter will also address the sense of control, pleasure, and self-worth that comes from managing one’s personal collection. The final chapter investigates the therapeutic elements of reborn dolls. Evidence from the context of doll therapy in dementia care demonstrates the benefits of doll play. Membership in a doll enthusiast community provides a sense of belonging for this oftentimes alienating interest. Big questions about the future of synthetic relationships (with dolls and also with artificial intelligences) are prompted by this investigation of actual doll relationships happening today. Reborn dolls are queer, fantastical, beloved by collectors from a range of economic, political and cultural backgrounds, and they will always remain uncanny. Understanding these fascinating objects tells us about a niche hobby grounded in physical touch that is surging in popularity in the midst of the ever-ephemeral and intangible digital age.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Combining Environmental Factors and Species Co-occurrence Patterns to Predict Species Abundance and Community Biomass: Method Development and Validation in Ontario Lakes</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Stahl, Aliénor Marie Eugénie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Predicting species abundance and community biomass is vital for ecosystem management, particularly in freshwater lakes, where this information guides conservation efforts, resource management, and biodiversity assessments. These metrics provide crucial insights into population dynamics, ecosystem productivity, and ecological balance. However, traditional models often rely on abiotic factors or limited species presence-absence data, missing the complex interspecies relationships that shape community structure and ecosystem function. This thesis aims to enhance predictive models of species abundance and biomass by incorporating community-level data, using latent variables derived from species co-occurrence and environmental variables. Latent variables are unobserved or hidden variables that are inferred from observed data. By integrating both biotic and abiotic factors, this approach enhances the accuracy of ecological predictions, offering more reliable tools for ecosystem management and conservation efforts. The three chapters build upon one another, progressively expanding the scope of the models and their applications. Chapter 2 lays the groundwork using simulated data to refine single-species abundance models, exploring how different levels of information (true environmental drivers versus latent variables based on species co-occurrence) affect model accuracy. This simulation framework is essential for understanding the robustness of the models before their application to real-world data. Chapter 3 extends this work by applying the developed framework to empirical data from lakes, focusing on sport fish species. It examines the role of latent variables and various fish assemblages in improving abundance predictions and explores how lake-specific characteristics influence model performance. This real-world application allows for a deeper understanding of how the framework operates under natural conditions, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. Finally, Chapter 4 uses the abundance predictions from Chapter 3 to develop a stacked model for predicting community biomass. It compares the stacked model’s effectiveness to a community model across varying spatial scales and species richness levels. By transitioning from single-species models to multi-species and ultimately biomass prediction, the chapters are sequentially linked, each addressing a broader ecological question while refining and testing the models at different levels of complexity. This cohesive approach enhances both the predictive accuracy of species abundance and the practical applications of these models for ecosystem management.

Prédire l’abondance des espèces et la biomasse des communautés est essentiel à la gestion des écosystèmes, particulièrement dans les lacs d’eau douce, où ces informations guident les efforts de conservation, la gestion des ressources, et les évaluations de la biodiversité. Ces métriques fournissent des connaissances cruciales sur la dynamique des populations, la productivité des écosystèmes et l’équilibre écologique. Cependant, les modèles traditionnels s’appuient souvent sur des facteurs abiotiques ou sur des données limitées sur présence-absence d’espèces, omettant les relations interspécifiques complexes qui façonnent la structure de la communauté et le fonctionnement de l’écosystème. Cette thèse vise à améliorer les modèles prédictifs d'abondance des espèces et de biomasse en incorporant des données à l'échelle de la communauté, et en utilisant des variables latentes dérivées de la cooccurrence des espèces et des variables environnementales. Les variables latentes sont des variables non observées ou cachées qui sont déduites à partir de données observées. En intégrant à la fois les facteurs biotiques et abiotiques, cette approche améliore la précision des prévisions écologiques, offrant des outils plus fiables pour la gestion des écosystèmes et les efforts de conservation. Les trois chapitres sont construits de manière séquentielle, élargissant progressivement la portée des modèles et leurs applications. Le Chapitre 2 pose les bases en utilisant des données simulées pour affiner les modèles d’abondance mono-espèce, en explorant comment différents niveaux d’information (véritables moteurs environnementaux par rapport aux variables latentes basées sur la cooccurrence des espèces) affectent la précision du modèle. Ce cadre de simulation est essentiel pour comprendre la robustesse des modèles avant leur application à des données réelles. Le Chapitre 3 étend ce travail en appliquant le cadre développé à des données empiriques de lacs, en se concentrant sur les espèces de poissons de sport. Il examine le rôle des variables latentes et de divers assemblages de poissons dans l’amélioration des prévisions d’abondance et explore comment les caractéristiques spécifiques des lacs influencent les performances du modèle. Cette application concrète permet de mieux comprendre le fonctionnement du cadre de modélisation dans des conditions naturelles, notamment dans les écosystèmes aquatiques. Enfin, le Chapitre 4 utilise les prévisions d’abondance du chapitre 3 pour développer un modèle empilé permettant de prédire la biomasse de la communauté. Il compare l’efficacité du modèle empilé à un modèle communautaire à travers différentes échelles spatiales et niveaux de richesse en espèces. En passant des modèles mono-espèces aux modèles multi-espèces et finalement à la prédiction de la biomasse, les chapitres sont liés séquentiellement, chacun abordant une question écologique plus large tout en affinant et en testant les modèles à différents niveaux de complexité. Cette approche cohésive améliore à la fois la précision prédictive de l’abondance des espèces et les applications pratiques de ces modèles pour la gestion des écosystèmes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Queer City Film: Experimental Cinema, Urban Life and the Erotics of Visibility</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The “queer city film” is proposed in this dissertation to be a corpus of experimental cinema and a critical method of spectatorship that establishes links between queer film history and studies of the cinematic city, two fields that have developed in parallel with little explicit overlap. The city is thus analyzed as an opportune vantage point for the discussion of concurrent inventions of homosexuality and cinema in Euro-American modernity. By establishing a continuity between the cinema-and-the-city discourse and queer film theory, this project identifies the emergence of subjective vision in modernity as a precondition for queer vision, thus proposing a new interpretative model for queer cinema that captures historical mediations of divergent expressions of gender and sexuality in visual media. Focusing on queer-authored experimental cinema set in recognizable urban locales across North America and Europe, the project puts film analysis into dialogue with queer theory, material culture studies, fashion and design studies, and cultural geography. To that end, city symphonies are analyzed as the earliest examples of the cinematic city representing a hermeneutics for the visual development of gender and sexual spectrums throughout film history. Gay pornography produced in the United States and Quebec is examined as a genre that put eroticism into dialogue with a documentary impulse, capturing the politically charged issues of queer visibility and public infrastructure through on-location shooting in cities such as San Francisco and Montreal. Finally, pre-digital queer experimental cinema of the twentieth century is surveyed for its sustained, yet often overlooked, interest in the closet of sexual secrecy as a conceptual and physical space denoting a range of domestic practices. By privileging experimental, avant-garde and erotic cinema over commercial film, and by gravitating towards the mediations of urban figures, spaces and surfaces over the narrative plot in queer cinema, the dissertation proposes an intermedial and historical approach to cinema as an archive of queer meanings and fantasies that challenges neat categories of gender and sexual identity, and expands their representational possibilities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Into the second decade of the 21st century, global media distribution is increasingly defined by platforms. This dissertation examines media localization by looking at three distinct production contexts, and analyses the social role that localizers play in promoting global media content. The localization of global media involves interactions among three key social actors: media companies, exemplified by platforms; governments, represented by policymakers; and finally, the focus of this dissertation, localizers, who function as conduits for channeling content to the general public. Employing a blend of ethnography, interviews, and cultural policy analysis, this study seeks to provide a thicker description of how localizers create a sense of locality, and how they perceive their own roles within broader systems of media circulation.

Each of the three case studies presented in this dissertation represents a distinct subculture within media production. The Quebec dubbing industry and its politics of nation and dialect provides a starting point, as a traditional example of localization. Here, dubbers not only provide translation services but also position themselves as uniquely attuned to the sensitivities of local populations. I then follow with an examination of Indigenous mainstream media producers, and their attempts to broaden their reach to global viewers by “internationalizing” their content. This process is similar to the idea of localization because it also requires careful adaptation of content for its desired audience. The third case study is of fan translators and anime commentators, whose work facilitates the adoption of global anime into local contexts by providing customized promotion. The towering presences of platforms and cultural policies are never too far from the discussion, modulating in powerful ways the work and professional aims of each of these groups.

Through these snapshots, the aim of the dissertation is to highlight the role of localization and its practitioners in creating a sense of the “local” in mediascapes defined by free and unrestricted flows of information.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Cultural-historical Shaping of Depression in China: Sociocultural Changes and Depressive Symptoms</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sun, Jiahong</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Depression is a major public health concern and a leading cause of contributor to the global burden of disease worldwide. Although a growing body of culturally informed research has documented notable variations in the nature and meaning of depression, mainstream clinical psychology largely glosses over the role of culture. An exception is the well-established finding that people of Chinese cultural heritage tend to emphasize bodily disturbances and deemphasize psychological problems. Cultural variations in the perceived value of attending to one’s own emotional experiences, along with cultural-historical differences in the social and political consequences of expressing distress psychologically, have been evoked to explain why Chinese sufferers from depression tend towards more somatic and less psychological symptom reporting in contrast to those in ‘Western’ societies. Following China’s ideological shift towards economic development, increasing research evidence indicates noteworthy sociocultural changes in individualistic values and emotional expression norms in Chinese people. Shifting cultural meanings and practices, in turn, could have important implications for understanding depression in today’s China. As such, the current project sought to examine the cultural-historical shaping of depression in the Chinese cultural context.
	Study 1 surveyed the current literature on the psychological consequences of China’s rapid modernization. Two themes, including a rising importance of individualism and an increasing but unevenly distributed prevalence of depression, emerged from this review. Study 2 examined urban and rural differences in depression and unpacked these group variations through the indirect effects of education and modernization values. As expected, rural patients reported higher levels of overall depressive symptoms and somatic symptoms of depression compared to their urban counterparts. In contrast, urban patients reported higher levels of psychological symptom emphasis, education, and modernization values. Endorsement of modernization values mediated the effects of group membership on depressive symptoms. Study 3 tested the temporal effect of depressive symptom presentation in three cohorts of Chinese patients. Over time, there was an increasing emphasis on psychological symptoms of depression while levels of somatic symptom reports were maintained. The findings of this research contribute to the existing literature on culture and mental health by demonstrating cultural variations of depression in different strata of Chinese society and highlighting the impact of historical change on culturally shaped expressions of depressive symptoms.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Rewilding second language learning: Non-formal learning through songs</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sundberg, Ross</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The goal of this manuscript-based dissertation is to explore French second language development through songs in the non-formal learning space to understand learners’ progression towards successful integration into informal environments. To explore the self-regulatory process required to increase autonomy and the degree to which music can aid learners in this pursuit, I examine new technologies and learners’ behaviours towards the use of music in second language contexts. This is done by following Cardoso’s (2022) chronological framework for examining new technologies in second language contexts because when learners engage with L2 music, they do so through technology. After providing an introduction and background on autonomy and the non-formal learning space (Chapter 1), the framework is explored through three manuscripts to investigate different aspects of language learning through songs and the use of the Bande à Part app (which was used as a tool to understand this approach).

The first manuscript (Manuscript A) investigates theoretical affordances provided by music as a form of L2 phonological exposure (e.g., acoustic comparisons between singing vs speaking) and form of content (e.g., type of vocabulary, rhyme schemes, and repetition). This manuscript highlights affordances provided by overlapping cognitive processes shared between language and music processing. For example, music encourages increased focus on form, which could help with pronunciation and exposure to drawn out vowels, leading to better formation of vowel categories. In terms of content, music is repetitive and motivating—two factors that are difficult to incorporate into the classroom. Empirical work on the impact of music on language development is interpreted with this in mind, supporting the theoretical affordances that were highlighted. Gaps are highlighted for future studies with the subsequent two chapters shedding light on some of these gaps.

The second manuscript (Manuscript B) assesses learners’ perceptions of suitability and acceptability of learning French with the Bande à Part music app (development and release documented in Sundberg &amp; Cardoso, 2019). Results demonstrate that learners believe the app helps improve their French and that it is relatively intuitive to use, although more instructions and more songs should be included. These perceptions are gathered because they are predictors of whether or not learners will use a tool, critical to self-directed contexts. The feedback gathered is also used to make iterative improvements to the app. The manuscript discusses principles and takeaways for future material developers who are interested in student-centred tools.

The third manuscript (Manuscript C) investigates learners’ awareness of language, the language learning process, and ability to self-regulate their own pronunciation development. This is accomplished through think-aloud exercises where participants listen to and then comment on recordings of themselves imitating sung and spoken audio recordings. This research helps to illuminate where scaffolding is needed and the degree to which learners can learn on their own.

The main findings emphasize the value of self-directed pedagogical tools, particularly songs, in enhancing L2 development. Educators and developers can use these insights to create more effective materials for language learners and support beyond the classroom learning endeavours.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Cyber-Attack Detection Methodologies for Cyber-Physical Systems: A System Theoretic Approach</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Taheri, Mahdi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are integral to critical infrastructures such as power networks, transportation systems, and water treatment networks. Despite the advancements in developing more secure CPS and monitoring systems, the number of successfully executed cyber-attacks in CPS has increased over the past decade. The mentioned cyber-attacks, which can make CPS unstable, are performed by intelligent adversaries who try to maintain their malicious attacks undetected. This thesis addresses several crucial challenges related to cyber-attacks in CPS and multi-agent systems (MAS).

The first part of the thesis focuses on simultaneous cyber-attacks and fault detection and isolation (CAFDI) in centralized and large-scale interconnected CPS. Proposed methodologies include centralized and distributed CAFDI approaches, incorporating two filters and an unknown input observer (UIO)-based detector to identify various deception attacks such as covert, zero dynamics, and replay attacks. The effectiveness of the distributed CAFDI approach is demonstrated through a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation of a four-area power network system.

The second part studies stealthy cyber-attacks in CPS, particularly zero dynamics, covert, and controllable attacks. Conditions for executing these attacks are derived from CPS Markov parameters and the system observability matrix. Dynamic coding schemes are proposed as countermeasures, increasing the number of actuators needed to execute cyber-attacks.

In the third part, zero dynamics and undetectable cyber-attacks in linear and nonlinear CPS are explored. A new security metric, security effort (SE), is introduced to determine the minimum number of secured actuators and sensors required to prevent such attacks in linear CPS. For nonlinear CPS, the study uses Koopman operator theory and the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) algorithm to create a finite-dimensional linear representation of the system to identify critical sensor measurements that need securing to prevent zero dynamics and covert attacks.

The fourth part addresses privacy-preserving consensus control, controllability cyber-attacks, undetectable cyber-attacks, and detection methodologies in MAS. A distributed transformation-based consensus control method is developed to protect agent privacy from eavesdroppers. Conditions for adversaries to control the MAS network by attacking a few agents are explored, defining these as controllability cyber-attacks. Undetectable cyber-attacks in MAS are defined and an event-triggered detection module to detect such attacks is proposed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Democracy’s Challenges: A Comprehensive Analysis of Political Support in Quebec and Canada</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tannahill, Kerry Lynne</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>political support, democratic governance, public opinion, survey research, systems analysis</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>While democratic support has been studied for decades, focusing on major cross-national trends and generalizations in public opinion has produced rather elusive conclusions on the overall state of democracy and its most pressing challenges or shortcomings. This is due, in part, to the lack of in-depth data that would allow us to parse out the complexities of citizens’ opinions about their democracies. 

This project begins to fill this gap, through the collection of large sample surveys conducted in Quebec in 2012 and 2014 and across Canada in 2017, under the Political Communities Survey Project (PCSP), while also drawing comparative baseline data from other large-scale national and international data sources. The purpose of the analyses in this project is to use these Canadian data as a starting point to map out political support both systemically (across the political system) and systematically (through the analysis of multiple indicators, testing several competing theoretical explanations for variations in support). 

The primary contribution of this project is the presentation of a more finely tuned, granular approach to the holistic understanding of perceptions of the democratic political system, one that may be drawn upon in the future by researchers interested in political support as well as by those seeking to address any democratic deficits that may exist. 

The approach presented in this project should, over the long term, produce the kinds of conclusions necessary to generate more targeted, adaptive solutions. For instance, the analyses illustrate that the ways in which citizens perceive those in power to be performing are key in understanding waning support, that public cynicism runs deep, and that superficial performance improvements may not be enough to remedy more deep-seated negative perceptions. The findings also reveal that complex identity patterns further complicate the support problem. In other words, any efforts aimed at addressing political support will require more targeted and sophisticated response strategies, informed by studies that pay careful attention to the entire political system (on a variety of aspects, using different assessment types) as well as to perspectives that are not generalizable (from different groups, across various sub-contexts).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Comprehensive Look at Intergroup Relations and Contact Between International Students and the Host Community</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tekin, Oguzhan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>international students, prejudice, integrated threat theory, linguistic threat</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Previous research has demonstrated that intergroup relations and contact between international students and host communities may be challenging. While international students sometimes experience discrimination on- or off-campus, international students themselves may also form negative attitudes toward host community members based on imagined or real experiences with them. Therefore, to address this issue, this dissertation set out to investigate variables that may lead to potentially prejudicial attitudes between international students and host community members and to examine the link between such attitudes and the quantity and quality of intergroup contact. 
Study 1 explored potential factors that inform francophone residents’ attitudes toward international students in English-medium universities in Montréal and examined the link between their quality and quantity of contact and their attitudes and perceived threat. First, between-group comparisons revealed similarly positive attitudes toward and relatively low levels of perceived threat from international students, except for linguistic threat, which was significantly higher for non-student francophones. Non-student francophones also reported considerably less frequent and lower quality of contact with international students. Second, while symbolic threat was the common predictor of attitudes for both student and non-student francophones, intergroup anxiety also emerged as a significant predictor of student francophones’ attitudes toward international students. Third, contact quality yielded significant associations with both attitudes (positive) and all types of perceived threat (negative except for stereotypes), whereas contact quantity was linked with intergroup anxiety only for student francophones.
Study 2 essentially replicated Study 1 to provide the international student perspective regarding intergroup attitudes and contact. International students reported similarly low perceived threat from (except for linguistic threat) as well as comparably high quality of contact with student and non-student francophones. However, they indicated significantly more favourable attitudes and more frequent contact with non-student francophones. While intergroup anxiety was the predictor of attitudes toward student francophones, stereotypes predicted their attitudes toward non-student francophones. Contact quality yielded positive links with attitudes and negative associations with all perceived threats, except for stereotypes. Contact quantity, on the other hand, was associated with intergroup anxiety, linguistic threat, and stereotypes only for non-student francophones.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Constrained Predictive Control Strategies for Feedback-Linearized Autonomous Wheeled Vehicles</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tiriolo, Cristian</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Model Predictive Control - Mobile Robots - Feedback Linearization - Self-Driving Cars - Tracking Control</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Autonomous vehicles are becoming increasingly widespread in various real-world applications, ranging from manufacturing and transportation to search and rescue operations. To perform these tasks effectively, it is crucial for the vehicle to be capable of solving trajectory tracking, path following, and obstacle avoidance problems. To improve the accuracy of the performed trajectory, the input constraints acting on the robot’s model should be directly included in the control design. Unfortunately, many of the available control algorithms are unable to do so.

In the last two decades of research, Model Predictive Control solutions have been developed to solve the considered control problems for autonomous wheeled vehicles. Nonlinear MPC schemes exploit accurate state predictions, however, the underlying computational demand might not be affordable in strict real-time contexts or when the robot's computation capabilities are limited. 
Conversely, linearized MPC approaches, have the important advantage of drastically reducing computational burdens at the expense of more conservative control performance. 

This research proposes a novel control paradigm to solve trajectory tracking, path following and obstacle avoidance problems for input-constrained wheeled mobile vehicles. The proposed solutions are applicable to both differential-drive and car-like robots, and they are the result of the combination of Model Predictive Control strategies and feedback linearization techniques.
First, it is shown that if a feedback linearized model of the robot is exploited for predictions in MPC, then the set of admissible inputs for the linearized model is a nonconvex and state-dependant polyhedron, leading to non-convex and computationally expensive optimization problems with local minima issues. Then, a novel worst-case circular approximation of the state-dependent input constraints set is analytically derived and used to design reference tracking controllers that are, by design, recursively feasible and non-conservative. 

The proposed predictive control paradigm has been successfully applied in real time to solve trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, and formation control problems for mobile robots and autonomous cars. 
The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed control framework are shown with simulations and laboratory experiments involving the Khepera IV differential-drive robots and Quanser Qcar, and its performance contrasted with state-of-the-art alternative control solutions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>How has community-based art led by women creators contributed to confronting violence and promoting peace in Colombia, a country recovering from a civil war? (1948-2016). This dissertation highlights the often-overlooked role of women in peacebuilding at a local level through their artistic endeavours. It focuses on the period from 2010 to 2024 when art practices adopted a communal approach, primarily driven by women from rural and peripheral communities. The thesis highlights how their creative work has become crucial in reconciliation outside official frameworks, allowing them to denounce and challenge violence and engage with their communities through art. 

The study establishes the concept of "arte denunciante" (art that denounces), encompassing art forms that confront violence, historical oppression, and systemic injustices in multiple contexts. Through the lenses of race and gender, it addresses how women's practices of "arte denunciate" have evolved from traditional approaches in museums and galleries to more inclusive, community-driven processes of social change. Thus, the research frames community-based “arte denunciante” as "invented spaces" and "sites of re-existence," showcasing their role in providing platforms for historically excluded voices and fostering communal reconciliation. By focusing on the creative strategies of Colombian women and their impact on local peace-building, the research underscores the broader relevance of “arte denunciante” as an approach applicable to global contexts experiencing conflict and violence. 

The methodology of this reserach, which incorporated a "SentirPensar" (feeling-thinking) approach, was based on genuine connections with artists, active listening, site visits, and critical analyses of case studies. As such, the research was developed through oral history interviews with eight artists creating “arte denunciate" and site visits conducted in four peripheral regions in Colombia, including two urban centers and two rural towns.�</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Data-driven Fault Detection and Diagnosis Frameworks for HVAC Systems using Probabilistic and Deep Generative Models</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tra, Viet</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The thesis tackles major challenges in developing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) models for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC systems are crucial for ensuring thermal and air comfort in buildings, but they frequently face inefficiencies due to inadequate maintenance, component wear and tear, and control issues, leading to considerable energy waste. The research highlights several key challenges, such as data contamination, lack of labeled data, and high dimensionality, which limit the effectiveness of traditional FDD methods.
To overcome these challenges, the thesis introduces innovative approaches: a supervised multiclass version of the deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model (DAGMM) that improves outlier detection by leveraging label information; a neural network-based approach for mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (NN-MPPCA) with a robust loss function for enhanced anomaly detection; a new framework combining variational autoencoders (VAE) with NN-MPPCA to handle high-dimensional data and incomplete datasets; and the adaptive adversarial autoencoder (AdaAAE), which refines anomaly detection with deep support vector data description (DSVDD). Comprehensive validation against cutting-edge algorithms highlights the superior performance of the proposed methods, leading to more efficient and reliable HVAC systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Is white matter the weakest link? - Early detection of white matter changes with MRI</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tremblay, Stéfanie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>White matter (WM) tracts play a crucial role in enabling efficient neural transmission, which is essential for optimal brain function. Once overlooked, WM is now recognized for its constant remodeling throughout life, responding to both enriching and adverse factors. These alterations in WM microstructure can enhance cognitive and motor performance through more efficient transmission, or conversely, contribute to functional decline. Notably, WM changes are among the earliest alterations observed in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias, highlighting the potential for WM as a target for early interventions.
However, our current knowledge is limited regarding: 1) the time scales at which plastic changes occur and 2) the biological mechanisms driving microstructural changes. This is largely due to the physiological non-specificity of commonly used neuroimaging techniques and the predominantly univariate focus of most studies in the field.
This Ph.D. thesis presents four original studies focused on investigating early WM changes in health and disease. The first study examines longitudinal plastic changes in WM following short-term motor learning in young, healthy participants, providing insights into activity-dependent WM remodeling. The second study introduces MVComp, an open-source toolbox developed to compute a multivariate distance metric—the Mahalanobis distance (D2). MVComp allows the integration of various imaging features, yielding individualized scores of deviation from a reference. 
The latter half of the thesis focused on the investigation of early pathological changes in WM among older adults at risk of dementia, using the multivariate framework developed in study two. The third study explored the relationship between WM alterations and cardiometabolic risk factors in older adults with a family history of AD. Individuals at higher genetic risk of AD (Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4) displayed a distinct pattern where LDL-cholesterol negatively impacted WM health, with myelination changes as the primary underlying mechanism. Finally, the fourth study assessed WM deviations in coronary artery disease patients, linking higher D2 scores in specific arterial territories to lower fitness levels and poorer cognition.
Together, these findings underscore the dynamic nature of WM changes and demonstrate that multivariate approaches offer a comprehensive characterization, shedding light on the biological mechanisms at play.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the 1912 Montreal Child Welfare Exhibition as part of a transnational public-education project that provided tools for the promotion of public health, child welfare, and the prevention of child and infant mortality in North America. During the Progressive Era, the population of cities increased and urban living conditions became a major concern for reformers, who were especially worried about a vulnerable group within this population: children. Child welfare exhibitions became an important component of the child-saving movement in the early 1910s, developed in response to the dangers and risks of the cities, as well as the alarming childhood and infant mortality rates. They were grassroots initiatives organized by communities seeking to share new education methods and to explain their philanthropic work around children’s well-being. The Montreal exhibition was based on an American model and largely influenced by the New York and Chicago exhibitions held the year before. Inviting readers on a virtual tour of the 1912 exhibition, the dissertation examines the different thematic sections of the Montreal event, which dealt in turn with the following child-related issues: health, housing and the city environment; education and religious training; recreation; philanthropy; juvenile court; and industrial conditions. The omnipresence of children in urban setting and the particular salience of the mother's responsibility are emphasized throughout the chapters. In Montreal, reformers from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds put their differences aside in this endeavor, designing and presenting a successful exhibition visited by over three hundred thousand people. The transnational lens shows that reformers worked together across countries and shared elite ideologies, beliefs, values, and attitudes, but also concepts of public health, moral and social regulation, nationalism, scientific motherhood, and materials for child welfare exhibitions. This study asserts that this heterogenous group had conflicting views regarding the origins of child welfare problems, blaming mothers or poverty, and proposed contrasting solutions in the exhibition materials. Overall, the thesis argues that the visual and experiential elements of the exhibition were central to the choice of this medium for the transnational public-education project on child welfare.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Saturation-based Algebraic Reasoning for Description Logic ALCHQ</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Vlasenko, Jelena</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this work we present a novel calculus for the description logic ALCHQ implemented in a reasoner named Avalanche. ALCHQ permits intersection, disjunction, and negation of concepts. It also allows existential and universal restrictions, role hierarchy, and qualified number restrictions that are of particular interest to us. Avalanche incorporates a number of widely applied and well known optimization techniques such as saturation, resolution, and linear optimization. We apply saturation to create a compressed version of a saturation graph. As a result, the overall size of the constructed model can be kept reasonably small. We employ resolution techniques in order to reason on disjunctions that are part of our calculus. Finally and most importantly, we leverage linear optimization to handle qualified number restrictions. We transform qualified number restrictions into linear programs and then apply the Branch-and-Price algorithm to solve them in the most efficient way. This novel approach gives us a clear advantage over the other reasoners that implement a more traditional procedure to deal with qualified number restrictions as there are ontologies containing entailments caused by the presence of qualified number restrictions that can be classified only by Avalanche.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Institutional pressures, internal fit, practice implementation, Safety Management System, safety qualitative and quantitative performance</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Understanding what forces within institutions could affect safety practice implementation and safety performance is critical to changing organizations and ensuring safety. This is particularly true in the global aviation context, for which safety is the primary objective. In this dissertation, I explore the interactive effects of institutional pressures and internal fit on Safety Management Systems (SMS) implementation and safety performance in aviation organizations. 
 	This research starts from a comprehensive literature review of four theories: institutional pressures, internal fit, SMS practice, and safety performance. Based on this review's observed performance and gaps, I propose theoretical models and hypotheses to investigate the interactive effects on practice fidelity and extensiveness implementation and quantitative and qualitative safety performance from the management perspective. A quantitative cross-sectional research design was adopted, and an online survey was developed and pretested. The sample was drawn from aviation organizations in the global setting. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) method and the Causal Path Analysis technique were used to access the theoretical models.
	The results highlight that while institutional pressures align with self-interest, self-interest positively affects organizational resource capability and SMS fidelity (establishment). In conflict situations, only institutional pressures impact SMS fidelity, and resource capability does not significantly impact SMS implementation. Moreover, SMS fidelity and resource capability fully mediate the relationship between interactive forces and SMS extensiveness in the alignment model. SMS fidelity alone fully mediates SMS extensiveness in the conflict model. SMS fidelity affects quantitative safety performance and safety culture. SMS extensiveness only directly impacts safety culture. Regulative pressures have a direct impact on quantitative safety performance, while non-regulative pressures do not have such a direct impact.
 	Understanding the effects of the interplay between institutional pressures and internal fit on SMS implementation and safety performance will advance SMS post-implementation and enhance regulatory policy establishment and practitioner practice implementation. These efforts will consequently improve safety performance, which is the prime objective of the global aviation community.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Social Interaction and Cultural Activities: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of Friendship Networks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Xie, Siming</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis consists of three chapters on social networks, focusing on cultural activities and social interactions.

Chapter 2 introduces a model of friendship formation that explores whether cultural activities can help reduce segregation across racial groups. The model incorporates a bias in the matching process, where individuals engaged in the same activities are more likely to form friendships. This framework aligns with empirical findings, including increased friendships among club members and reduced segregation when students from different racial backgrounds participate equally in cultural activities.

Chapter 3 presents an empirical analysis of club participation, examining how individual decisions are shaped by social norms. The findings indicate that white students participating in basketball and black students in baseball are influenced by the size of their racial group, whereas this effect is not observed for the reverse combinations. Using a Linear-in-Mean (LIM) model, the study reveals that previous research may overestimate peer effects on individual decisions, mainly due to the endogeneity of friendship networks. The results suggest that cultural clubs play a role in fostering social cohesion across racial groups.

Chapter 4 presents a model that examines how social norms influence students' decisions to participate in clubs, highlighting a trade-off between the costs of participation and the benefits of social engagement. The model predicts that as school size increases, participation rates decline, but a higher proportion of devotee members are committed to the club. Moreover, social engagement has a stronger influence on participation decisions in larger schools. Empirical data support these predictions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>As urbanization and population growth have increased over the past decade, more construction has been built in urban areas to form large metropolitan areas. Researchers are paying more attention to the link between human activities and the immediate surroundings – urban microclimate –to improve the quality of life and minimize adverse impacts on the environment and climate. This thesis focuses on the urban microclimate and its impact on outdoor thermal comfort and building energy performance. This study will start a comprehensive literature review presenting the latest progress in urban microclimate research on urban wind and thermal environment, covering methods and practical issues.
For the short-term analysis, this research studies how urban configuration affects the urban microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort. In the present work, temperature distribution at three different urban areas will be simulated during a summer heatwave in 2013 in Montreal, Canada. The impact of different building configurations on the flow pattern will be investigated. What’s more, thermal comfort and the impact of heatwaves on the human body will be considered by humidex (humidity index). The results show that this model is capable of estimating local microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort.
An artificial neural network (ANN) model is also presented in this study to predict urban microclimates based on long-term measurements from local weather stations near urban buildings and their significance in analyzing building energy consumption. The ANN model could connect local and remote meteorological parameters for a whole year. The 20-year historical weather data at the airport was then used to generate a local TMY, and then building heating and cooling loads were analyzed. This method was evaluated for five weather stations to assess the impact of the local microclimate on the energy consumption of buildings. 
This study underscores the crucial role of urban microclimate in building energy consumption through both short-term and long-term evaluations. Accurate prediction of local weather conditions around buildings is essential within urban microclimates. The research introduces a pioneering approach using an artificial neural network model for predicting microclimate parameters based on extensive onsite measurements, emphasizing its significance in building energy analysis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Offshore oil exploration and production in deep water are associated with environmental risks to marine ecosystems. An effective oil spill response critically relies on understanding the transport and fate of spilled petroleum in complex marine environmental compartments. Oil spill models have been used for decades to help responders make informed decisions by forecasting the movement and fate of released petroleum fluids. However, few existing operational tools could capture the sophisticated behaviors of deep-sea oil spills under extreme ranges of ambient conditions. A deepwater oil spill model (DWOSM) is developed in this study to predict the trajectory and weathering processes of subsea blowouts. This system incorporates droplet size distribution model, buoyant plume model, near- and far-field particle tracking algorithms, and various advanced fate algorithms into three modules: DWOSM-DSD aims to predict the quasi-stationary droplet size distribution resulting from a blowout; DWOSM-Nearfield is to simulate near-field plume dynamics; DWOSM-Farfield forecasts the trajectory and fate of dispersed oil and gas beyond the near-field. Unlike most other oil spill models, DWOSM introduces near-field particle tracking to enable a smooth transition between near-field and far-field. It also takes advantage of thermodynamic modeling to predict the evolution of oil and gas's physicochemical and thermodynamic properties in deep water. In addition to model development, a state-of-the-art stochastic simulation-based risk assessment framework is improved by embedding the DWOSM and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-related risk evaluation index. 
	The application of DWOSM is demonstrated in three cases. The first study case is a hypothetical oil blowout in 800 m of offshore waters of East Newfoundland, Canada. The DWOSM and its each module are juxtaposed with some established oil spill models. The verification shows that predictions in DWOSM are primarily in line with other model outputs. Different choices in fate algorithms cause a particular discrepancy in simulation results. Multiple spill scenarios are implemented to investigate the impacts of weathering processes on oil fate numerically, which reveals the vital role of natural dispersion in surface oil mitigation under windy conditions. Second, DWOSM is applied to perform a hindcast of the largest offshore oil spill in US history, the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout. Primary model outputs, such as surfaced gas composition and surface oil trajectory, are validated through field observations and relevant modeling efforts. A good performance is presented in most validation results, manifesting the reliable capability of DWOSM to simulate deep-sea spill behaviors. Last, the newly developed model is integrated into a risk assessment framework to evaluate the subsea blowout risk in the offshore area of East Newfoundland. Data mining techniques are used to extract representative met-ocean conditions from long-term hydrodynamic and atmospheric reanalysis products, making computationally demanding stochastic oil spill modeling practicable. A series of deterministic simulations corresponding to each met-ocean condition are conducted to yield regional oil spill hazard and risk mapping. The spill scenarios with and without applying subsea chemical dispersants are formulated to analyze their efficacy on spill mitigation. The results indicate a low-risk level around the nearshore waters of the study area, but PAH exposure can jeopardize the aquatic biota in the oil-infested region. Moreover, dispersant use can reduce the risk peak but facilitate the dissemination of oil spills.
In conclusion, this research contributes a novel modeling toolkit for predicting the complex behaviors of deep-sea blowouts and an improved stochastic simulation-based risk assessment methodology to quantitatively evaluate the regional subsea spill risk.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>How Loneliness Shapes Socially Responsible Consumption</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Yazdanian, Nasrin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>loneliness, consumer behavior, socially responsible consumption, social isolation</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines when and why lonely consumers choose products that benefit others. According to the Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness, while loneliness promotes motivations to socially connect and develop relationships, it also enhances focus on self-preservation motives and implicit hypersensitivity to social threats. Prior literature demonstrates that increased self-centeredness and social pain derived from feelings of loneliness lead lonely individuals to prioritize their own interests over the interests of others and seek their own welfare. However, under certain conditions, lonely individuals may sacrifice personal interests for the benefit of others (i.e., when there is a chance to socially connect with others or to signal their unique identity).
This research explores how loneliness influences socially responsible consumption, operationalized as a preference for socially responsible products (e.g., fair trade tea or coffee, child-labor-free apparel, eco-friendly cleaning products, organic cotton apparel). Specifically, it investigates whether the type of beneficiary of socially responsible choice (human or the environment) evokes different responses from lonelier individuals.
Across five studies, the results suggest that lonelier consumers exhibit a lower preference for socially responsible products linked to benefits for humans but not for the environment. The findings elucidate the underlying process in various ways: the mediation analyses in Studies 1 and 2 show that loneliness lowers compassion for others, which reduces preferences for socially
responsible products benefiting humans but not the environment. Introducing interventions focusing on compassion in Studies 3 and 4 reveal that lonely individuals who experience self-affirmation and Loving-Kindness Meditation practices exhibit greater compassion toward others, consequently, increasing the likelihood of choosing socially responsible products associated with benefits for humans. Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that temporal distance (future vs. immediate consumption) alters lonely consumers' preferences and decreases the negative impact of loneliness on preference for socially responsible products associated with benefits for humans but not for the environment.
The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, including alternate pathways for engaging lonely consumers in socially responsible consumption, specifically for products associated with human benefits.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring Convex Optimization and Transformer based Methods for Efficient Visual Object Tracking</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Yelluru Gopal, Goutam</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The effectiveness of a visual object tracking algorithm heavily relies on how well it represents the target object through a collection of feature templates, or channels. However, some channels lose their discriminative power during challenging video conditions such as target deformation, occlusion, and motion blur, leading to tracking failures. Discriminative Correlation Filter-based (DCF) trackers address these video challenges by aggregating hand-crafted and deep Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) channels. However, this approach increases the computational complexity of the tracker and significantly reduces inference speed, especially on constrained hardware such as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) or edge devices. We observe a parallel trend in end-to-end trainable deep Siamese Network-based (SN) trackers, which deploy parameter-heavy backbones for feature extraction and rely on specialized hardware such as a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for faster inference. In this thesis, we propose computationally efficient solutions to both DCF and SN tracking algorithms while improving their accuracy. 

For multi-channel DCF tracking, we present three solutions to alleviate the impact of non-discriminative features (or channels). These methods leverage the concept of reliability to quantify the discriminative power of a feature (or a channel) based on its filter response. The proposed solutions dynamically lower the weightage of unreliable features (or channels) while emphasizing the temporal smoothness of the learned weights. We formulate the process of learning adaptive weights as a convex optimization problem and derive efficient solutions to maintain tracking speed. Expanding on the lightweight SN tracking paradigm, our first algorithm, MVT, employs a cascaded arrangement of CNN and transformer blocks in its backbone. This approach fuses template and search regions during feature extraction to generate superior feature encoding for target localization. Our second tracking algorithm, a Separable Self and Mixed Attention Transformer-based tracker (SMAT), further increases the efficiency of MVT by replacing the standard attention with a computationally efficient separable attention block. Proposed trackers exhibit superior performance on eight challenging benchmarks compared to the related lightweight trackers, with SMAT emerging as the top performer. The computationally efficient architecture enables our MVT and SMAT trackers to run at real-time tracking speed on a CPU, while achieving a high speed of 150 frames-per-second on a GPU.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Change, Institutional Logic, Field Transformation, Technology trajectories, Materiality, Pace, Failure, de-settlement, Cross sector partnership, place making, imagination work, emotions, hybrid partnership, framing contest, escalation.</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation contributes to advancing a comprehensive framework for understanding the socio-materiality of fields and their dynamics. The first article explores the co-evolutionary dynamics between technology trajectories and institutional pathways, emphasizing the temporal dimension of change, specifically the pace of change. In the second article, the focus shifts to the de-settlement of cross-sector partnerships within a technology field, highlighting how framing contests at the project level, coupled with partnership-level strategies, paradoxically escalate tensions in pathways and lead to cross sector partnership de-settlement. The third paper delves into the co-evolution of place trajectories by examining the interplay between imagination and emotional work. Collectively, these papers address two fundamental dimensions of change: materiality, represented by technology (papers 1 and 2), and place (paper 3), and temporality, specifically the pace of change (paper 1). While the first paper offers a framework for understanding the pace of change through the co-evolution of technology and institutional logic in field emergence and transformation stages, the second and third papers zoom in on the change trajectory during the decline/de-settlement stage, an area less studied in institutional change scholarship. These papers complement each other by focusing on temporality and dynamics while also considering durability and stability in the change process.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Building the Science Behind the Design and Development of Nutrition-Focused Behavioural Interventions Adjunct to Metabolic Bariatric Surgery</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Yousefi, Reyhaneh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis aims to explore the basic behavioural science guiding the design and development of nutrition-focused behavioural interventions adjunct to metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). It comprises three systematic reviews to; 1) evaluate the quality of intervention reporting; 2) identify the potentially active content of interventions; and 3) explore perceived barriers and enablers to modifying post-operative dietary behaviours.

In Study one, the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was applied to evaluate the completeness of intervention reporting. In Study two, intervention materials were coded using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1). In addition to descriptive methods, effect size calculations were used to assess the impact of the interventions on weight outcomes. In Study three, data reporting barriers and enablers to modifying diet after MBS were analysed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Barriers/enablers were mapped to BCTs to identify potential intervention strategies.

Among the 22 included interventions, none of them completely reported all intervention descriptors in the TIDieR checklist, with an average of 6.6/12 items being fully reported. The areas where reporting required improvement were; providing adequate details of the materials and procedures of the interventions; intervention personalisation; and modifications during the study. Common BCTs reported in interventions included: Instruction on how to perform a behaviour; Self-monitoring of behaviour; Goal setting (behaviour); Problem solving; Social support (unspecified); and Action planning. The BCTs that were only found in the most efficacious interventions (Monitoring of behaviour by others without feedback and Information about antecedents) were not among the most frequent techniques. Key factors influencing post-operative dietary behaviour change were in the categories of Environmental Context and Resources; Behavioural Regulation; Emotions; Beliefs about Consequences; and Social Influences. Potential strategies (BCTs) to support postoperative dietary behaviour change are in line with our findings in study two. 

The poor quality of intervention reporting in the current literature limits the potential for evidence synthesis across studies. Addressing barriers to post-operative dietary change, ensuring transparent intervention reporting through behavioural science tools, and frameworks will contribute to the development of interventions that not only engage and mobilise patients towards positive behaviour change but also produce replicable evidence to inform clinical practice.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Numerical Investigation of Ultrasound-Triggered Microbubble Contrast Agent Dynamics</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Yusefi, Hossein</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Biomedical ultrasound is widely employed as an imaging modality for anatomical assessment and to provide information on blood flow characteristics. There is increasing interest in employing microbubble contrast agents for diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound. Unlike MR and CT agents, ultrasound contrast agents are comparable in size to a red blood cell, providing a purely intravascular agent for clinical radiology. Microbubbles are currently clinically employed in echocardiography and liver applications, as well as pre-clinically, for the tumors' characterization and quantifying perfusion. Critical to the effectiveness of contrast agent microbubbles is an understanding of their nonlinear vibrations and scattering within the vasculature, specifically within the microvasculature where standard ultrasound flow estimation suffers from slow blood velocity and low red blood cell concentration.
Using mainly a finite element computational approach, this thesis aims to investigate the nonlinear physics of ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles within small capillaries to shed some light on the vibration dynamic and behavior of microbubble contrast agents. Over three chapters of results, this thesis analyses the complex vibration dynamics of microbubbles in proximity to each other and confined in a viscoelastic vessel. The results provided in this thesis explain how the resonance behavior of a microbubble is dampened and shifted by its neighboring bubbles and how smaller bubbles show off-resonance activities corresponding to the resonance behavior of the bigger, neighboring bubbles. The results also explain how initial phospholipid packing and bubble
proximity affect subharmonic response and how a viscoelastic vessel dampens resonance behavior and amplifies off-resonance behavior.
This thesis conducts a robust study on ultrasound-stimulated microbubble-compliant vessel interactions. It will contribute to optimal contrast agent design for both imaging and therapy, image quantification, and the development of new ultrasound pulse sequences.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Wide-area monitoring, protection and control (WAMPAC) systems have emerged as a promising solution to improve situational awareness of power grid operators. WAMPAC systems collect system-wide measurements through communication infrastructure, synchronize using global positioning system (GPS) in phasor measurement units (PMUs), and utilize them to evaluate teh system operation condition and make appropriate real-time protection and control decisions. Despite teh provided advantages, teh reliance of WAMPAC systems on information and communication technologies (ICTs) makes them prone to various cyber attacks. Teh socioeconomic impacts of teh real-world cyber-attacks on power grids such as teh 2015 Ukraine power grid attack have prompted teh national level institutions to initiate several road-maps emphasizing teh necessity of new adoptions toward cyber security enhancement in teh North America power grids. To take step toward dis adaptation, dis thesis initially investigates teh vulnerability of wide-area applications in integrated power and gas systems (IPGSs) and proposes a preventive defense strategy and online neural network detection scheme. Afterward, dis thesis emphasizes on teh vulnerability of data aggregation standards and protocols in WAMPAC systems to time-synchronization attacks (TSAs). During prevention phase, dis thesis proposes a robust optimization model to obtain communication configuration between PMUs and control centers in order to minimize TSA consequences. Following teh prevention phase, dis thesis proposes an integrated TSA detection and mitigation scheme. Teh TSA detection scheme is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which captures teh temporal correlation of data quality information to identify and localize TSAs. In teh mitigation phase, a new robust state observer mitigation scheme is proposed for wide-area control applications. Eventually, dis thesis emphasizes on vulnerability of grid supporting functions in inverter-based resources (IBRs) to a resonance cyber-attack. As a countermeasure, dis thesis proposes a new wavelet-enabled wide neural network model which not only detects resonance FDIAs on grid-connected IBRs, but also distinguishes them from normal system events. Numerical results from multiple test benchmarks demonstrate dat teh proposed prevention, detection, and mitigation schemes in dis thesis not only improve teh security of wide-area control applications but also do not compromise normal system performance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Cooperative robotic system for automated fiber placement (AFP) is a promising solution to fulfill the requirement of manufacturing fiber composites on intricate structures. This project works on the trajectory planning and control of a 13-degree-of-freedom (13-DOF) AFP system. A 1-DOF rotary stage is attached to the end-effector of a 6-Revolute-Spherical-Spherical (6-RSS) parallel robot to hold a Y-shape mandrel, while an AFP head is attached to the end-effector of a 6-DOF serial robot to place fiber with the desired degree. A photogrammetry sensor C-Track 780 can measure the real-time end-effector pose of the robots.

To ensure the desired cooperation performance and limit the communication cost, a distributed control structure with an event-triggered network is developed, based on the measured end-effector pose of the serial robot. An adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) is employed to address uncertain noises in pose estimation. A leader-follower trajectory planning strategy is proposed with the serial robot as the leader and the parallel robot as the follower. A time-jerk optimal trajectory planning scheme is designed for the serial robot considering the kinematic and dynamic constraints. To compensate the serial robot motion and satisfy the AFP geometric constraints, a vision-based trajectory generation approach is developed for the parallel robot.

A position-based visual servoing (PBVS) strategy is proposed for the parallel robot in Cartesian space. To enable the robot to effectively track different trajectories under time-varying conditions, an adaptive sliding mode control method using radial basis function (RBF) neural network is developed to guarantee system robustness and realize the self-tuning of the control gains. In the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances, a distributed control approach based on adaptive sliding mode controller (ASMC) is developed for the two robots. A deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) is employed to estimate the lumped system uncertainties. The DRNN demonstrates superior learning capability and dynamic adaptability compared to shallow feedforward neural networks. Based on Lyapunov theorem, the stability analyses of the controllers have been done. 

The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms have been validated by simulation and experiment, and comparisons are made with the previous published work.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Consequence-based Algebraic Reasoning for SHOQ</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Qualified Cardinality Restrictions (QCRs) and nominals are the two constructors in OWL 2 DL to apply numerical restrictions on domain concepts and relations. Utilizing these constructors in designing real-world ontologies is unavoidable in many domains, particularly in modelling structures with complex objects. Most existing DL reasoners employ arithmetically uninformed processes to reason about these numeric restrictions by exploring all possible cases.
Meanwhile, Consequence-Based (CB) reasoning algorithms have proven to have a phenomenal performance in practice. However, they have yet to be extended for the expressive DL SHOQ - a DL that supports named individuals and cardinality restrictions. This research presents a novel consequence-based algorithm to classify SHOQ while handling the arithmetic interaction between QCRs and Nominals using atomic decomposition and integer linear programming. The proposed calculus can classify the whole ontology in one round. We have implemented our calculus in a prototype reasoner called CARON.
Empirical evaluation of our implementation demonstrates that CARON outperforms existing reasoners in handling numerical restrictions. At the same time, it offers a competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art systems. Our results also show that CARON nicely complements existing reasoners for handling numerical restrictions since it provides an arithmetically informed process for handling these constructors. Accordingly, the calculus and implementation presented in this thesis are critical to improving practical reasoning with expressive DLs, including numerical restrictions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Assessing Urban Overheating Under Climate Change through Representative Methods on Large Spatial and Temporal Scales</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Zou, Jiwei</etd_ms:creator>

        <etd_ms:description>Climate change has led to prolonged, more frequent, intense, and severe extreme weather events, such as summertime heatwaves, creating many challenges on the economy and society and human health and energy resources. For example, the 2010 and 2018 heatwave in Quebec, Canada, resulted in about 280 and 93 heat-related deaths, and there were around 500 fatalities due to overheated indoor environments in 2021 around entire Canada. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate historical urban overheating conditions as well as predict the future scenarios. Considering a large temporal scale when assessing future climates (up to hundred years) and a large spatial scale when assessing the microclimate of an entire urban area, this thesis developed a representative method which could serve for both large temporal and spatial scale to select typical and extreme scenarios for overheating assessment. 
Firstly, future indoor and outdoor overheating conditions are evaluated in Canadian cities by assessing the effectiveness of a reference year selection method. Onsite long-term climate data sourced from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) is bias-corrected and analyzed to evaluate overheating conditions in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver under various future climate scenarios.  Secondly, the typical and extreme days are selected from reference year as the input of CityFFD-CityBEM co-simulation for assessing climate change impacts on urban overheating in downtown Montreal. The analysis points out a shift from mild thermal stress to extreme heat stress under future climate conditions, highlighting the critical need for interventions in urban design and infrastructure to maintain outdoor comfort. Last but not least, this thesis expands the scope by developing a spatial and temporal representative method combined with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and CityFFD simulations to evaluate overheating across Montreal. The results emphasize the importance of selecting representative locations for simulations to accurately capture the varying microclimate conditions across the city. Findings suggest significant increases in urban heat, necessitating targeted mitigation strategies.
The contributions of this thesis are significant in advancing the understanding of urban overheating dynamics and mitigation strategies. It provides municipalities and urban planners with validated tools and methods to forecast and counteract the adverse effects of urban overheating. This research underscores the critical role of detailed, localized climate simulations in urban planning and highlights innovative strategies to enhance urban resilience against climate change-induced overheating.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Learning Contextual Vision Representations via Masking</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Supervised learning on large-scale labeled datasets has been critical to the success of computer vision, with widespread applications in robotics, healthcare, security, sports, and retail. To address challenges of over-dependence on labeled data, self-supervised learning aims to learn from data without annotations. However, new problems arise, such as the difficulty in defining appropriate pretext tasks, increased computational demands from multiple stages, and the need for large amounts of unlabeled data. In this thesis, we introduce a learning paradigm that models global and local context for semantic segmentation. The proposed method effectively captures pixel relationships, improving performance in ambiguous regions and better segmenting minority classes through masking. We show that our approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art single and multi-task learning baselines in both binary and multi-class semantic segmentation tasks, particularly in tackling small, ambiguous regions in medical images and minority class instances in cluttered scenes. Motivated by the intuition that occluded objects are partial inputs, we propose a single-stage, model-agnostic approach for multi-label image recognition. The proposed method learns contextualized representations using a masked branch and models label co-occurrence through label consistency. Experimental results demonstrate the simplicity, applicability, and, more importantly, the competitive performance of our approach against previous state-of-the-art methods, especially in identifying small and occluded objects. Additionally, we propose an efficient unsupervised object localization method that can segment unfamiliar objects in images without the need for additional training, particularly when they are small, reflective, or poorly illuminated. The proposed method learns context-based representations at both the pixel- and shape-level using only a single learnable convolutional layer decoder and a frozen encoder. We demonstrate on six benchmarks datasets the simplicity, efficiency and competitive performance of our approach in both single object discovery and unsupervised salient object detection, outperforming existing methods that require intensive computational resources, extensive training, and large data volumes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Reinforced masonry shear walls (RMSWs) provide lateral stability to reinforced masonry (RM) structures, especially in seismic-prone regions. They are categorized into fully grouted (FG) and partially grouted (PG) types. While FG-RMSWs offer high strength and stiffness suitable for high-seismic zones, PG-RMSWs are more cost-effective, reducing grouted cells while balancing performance and economy. Despite their economic benefits, PG-RMSWs are mainly used in low-rise buildings due to limited research on their seismic behavior in mid- and high-rise structures. This study investigates the in-plane quasi-static and dynamic responses of flexure-dominated RMSWs, focusing on grouting (PG vs. FG), cross-sectional configurations (rectangular and with boundary elements (BEs)), and shear reinforcement setups (bond beam reinforcement (BBR) vs. bed joint reinforcement (BJR)). The goal is to optimize CSA S304 seismic design provisions and expand the application of RMSWs in mid- and high-rise buildings.
The research consists of two phases. Phase I, “Shear and Flexural Behavior Enhancement of RMSWs,” includes experimental tests on flexural-dominated PG-RMSWs under quasi-static cyclic loading, as well as masonry wallets under diagonal tension. Two PG-RMSWs with identical aspect ratios, axial stresses, and flexural capacities but different cross-sectional configurations (rectangular and with BEs) were tested. Additionally, 34 masonry assemblages and 40 prisms with varying mortar and grout strengths and reinforcement configurations were evaluated to understand their shear and compressive behaviors. Results indicated that PG-RMSWs with BJR showed ductile behavior, significant energy dissipation, and enhanced shear strength, supporting their use in mid-rise buildings and informing updates to CSA S304.
Phase II involves numerical studies to analyze the lateral cyclic response of RMSWs under quasi-static and dynamic loading using the Applied Element Method (AEM) with Extreme Loading for Structures (ELS) software. Comparisons between PG-RMSWs with BBR or BJR and FG-RMSWs with different configurations revealed that PG-RMSWs had comparable ductility and drift capacities to FG-RMSWs, achieving up to 41% material savings.
Overall, the experimental and numerical findings emphasize the need to revisit seismic design provisions and shear strength equations in CSA S304 for PG and FG masonry. This research advances the economical use of PG-RMSWs in mid- and high-rise buildings, promoting their broader application in performance-based seismic design.</etd_ms:description>
