        <etd_ms:description>Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are one of the critical technologies that play a key role in environmental monitoring, ocean exploration, and marine security. UWSNs are deployed in harsh environments face aggressive conditions, limited energy, and bound communication bandwidth; maintenance is very expensive since ship missions are required to recover to deployed nodes. However, it reduces efficiency, reliability, and lifetime. This thesis presents the issues of reliability and lifetime issues of UWSNs by proposing an integrated method using fault-tree analysis (FTA), mean time between failures (MTBF), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and reliability metrics. The proposed framework analyzes and compares the reliability and lifetime of existing UWSNs. 
Furthermore, the thesis delves into the critical aspect of reliability analysis for low-cost underwater sensor nodes, which are becoming increasingly prevalent due to their affordability. A model is proposed for estimating the reliability of such nodes from individual component reliabilities. Case studies on existing low-cost underwater sensor node designs are used to validate this model.
The thesis integrates these methods to devise a framework that achieves substantial enhancement in reliability and lifetime, especially for cost-effective node-based UWSNs. That is to say, this will go a long way in establishing Underwater Sensor Networks as much more reliable and efficient in their operations for different applications. Moreover, the improvement in circuit reliability helped come up with a better design that improved upon its reliability and extended its lifetime.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Mechanical Performance of Foam-Infilled 3D-Printed 
Corrugated Core Sandwich Panels: 
Experimental and Numerical</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Abdali, Marjan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study investigates the mechanical performance of 3D-printed corrugated core sandwich panels under compression and bending loads through experimental and numerical methods. Initially, panels were fabricated with polylactic acid (PLA) skins and cores featuring triangular, trapezoidal, rectangular, and circular geometries. Experimental testing revealed that rectangular cores exhibited the highest compression strength, while triangular cores performed best under bending due to their superior stiffness-to-weight ratio. The circular and trapezoidal cores were found to maintain median performance under both compression and bending. Various failure mechanisms were observed within the corrugated core samples, including buckling, delamination, and core fracture. Subsequently, recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam inserts were added to the corrugated core channels to further improve the performance of the panel. The foam, recognized for its high strength-to-weight ratio, moisture resistance, and thermal insulation properties, significantly increased the compressive strength of the panels by 200-345% with only a 32.5% increase in weight. Similarly, the flexural strength improved by 170-267% while the weight increased by an average of 40%. The foam inserts delayed buckling, improved structural stability, and enhanced the ability of the panels to absorb energy under load. With the addition of foam failure, mechanisms such as foam fracture, densification, and foam shear were observed. Ultimately, finite element models were developed on ABAQUS for each core geometry. These models enabled the simulation of both compression and bending performance, evaluating the effect of change in geometric parameters and optimizing corrugated core structures. The model's predictions were validated against experimental results, showing good correlation and providing insight into how different geometries influence mechanical behavior. The simulation helps identify optimal designs for enhanced load-bearing capacity and energy absorption by adjusting core geometry. These results emphasize the importance of core geometry and foam inserts in optimizing sandwich panel designs for multi-functional and high-performance applications within diverse industries.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The effect of protein source on weight loss, body composition, and substrate oxidation following a 12-week high-protein, ketogenic diet: A randomized trial</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Abramczuk, Rachel</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Background: Ketogenic diets, diets high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates, have been shown to be effective for weight loss. Recently, plant-based diets and protein sources have gained in popularity as they are thought to be a healthier alternative to animal-based protein sources. There is limited evidence as to whether protein source impacts ketogenic dietary outcomes.

Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate how plant- and animal-based protein supplementation impact weight loss, body composition, and substrate oxidation following a 12-week high-protein, hypocaloric, ketogenic diet in adults with obesity.

Methods: Adults with obesity were recruited and randomized (N= 35) to receive a 12-week high-protein ketogenic diet which included plant- or animal-based protein supplements. Body composition was assessed through dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed tomography (CT). Substrate oxidation was assessed via indirect calorimetry before and after the intervention.

Results: Both the plant-based and animal-based groups saw significant reductions in overall weight, fat mass, and fat-free mass (p&lt;0.001 for all). The plant-based group saw a significant reduction in carbohydrate oxidation (p=0.037), a trend to suggest an increase in lipid oxidation (p=0.054), and a trend to suggest a decrease in respiratory exchange ratio (p=0.057). There were no differences in any body composition variables nor resting energy expenditure following the intervention for either group.

Conclusion: Our results indicate that regardless of protein source, people who followed a 12-week high-protein ketogenic diet saw significant loss of weight, fat mass, and fat-free mas. Following a 12-week plant-based high-protein ketogenic diet may lead to a reduction in carbohydrate oxidation and an increase in lipid oxidation, but this may be due to differences in baseline dietary composition and further research is needed to determine the validity of the proposed conclusion.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The Sims, a life simulation video game series, has evolved into a platform for gender, femininity, and lifestyle performance on Instagram, known as Simstagram. This study explores how Sims players construct and perform identities within the contexts of game studies, influencer culture, and postfeminist social media evolution. Using digital ethnography and text analysis of 803 posts and 1,163 unique images from 105 accounts, I investigate identity embodiment at the intersection of authenticity, performativity, Instagram's postfeminist influencer culture, and platform affordances. Key findings reveal that Simstagrammers engage in sophisticated identity construction, balancing aspirational content with relatable authenticity by leveraging both the Sims game mechanics and Instagram's platform features. My analysis of the complex interplay between performativity, authenticity, and embodiment in Simstagram reveals a blend of contextual expectations regarding The Sims game and Instagram where Simstagram users create and present their virtual identities in ways that align with the cultural and mechanical expectations of The Sims game, while also adhering to the norms and practices of authenticity valued in Instagram's influencer culture. The concept of "meta-influencers" emerges as a central theme, describing Simstagrammers who embody influencer practices within virtual personas while reflecting upon and playing with influencer culture conventions, hinting at the fundamental idea that anyone has the potential to become an influencer. My research contributes to understanding how individuals navigate and create meaning in complex digital ecosystems, reflecting and contributing to broader influencer culture while offering a unique lens to examine contemporary gender representations and identity construction in digital spaces.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Additive Word-Problem Solving in Children With Language Difficulties: A Descriptive Analysis of Strategies and Errors</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Achim, Éloïse</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting linguistic abilities, can experience difficulties throughout their schooling, such as in mathematics. Solving word problems, a language-dependent task, requires children to understand the text, and identify the semantic relationships between the problem’s quantities to solve them. Therefore, gaining insights on the effects of DLD on word-problem solving can help support the learning of children with DLD. The present study compares the word-problem solving abilities of typically-developing (TD) children (n = 28) and children with DLD (n = 16). Children were recruited in schools in Montreal, Quebec City, and Sherbrooke, or in private speech-language pathology’ clinics. During two videorecorded sessions, students were invited to solve additive word problems created by the research team. The groups were compared on accuracy, the appropriateness of their strategies, and error types. Also, a strategy profile was assigned to each child based on the most frequent strategy used to explore potential differences among the groups. The findings of this study highlight significant differences between the groups on accuracy, strategy appropriateness, and the frequency and types of errors produced. DLD appears to affect the way children understand the text, identify relevant information, abstract the problem structure, use a strategy aligned with the problem structure, and compute answers. In contrast, the distribution of the strategy profiles is similar in each group: They tend to use the standard algorithm (e.g., formal procedure taught in class) even if they make mistakes. Moreover, they still rely on manipulatives to solve word problems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Development and Characterization of a Novel Hybrid Magnetorheological Elastomer</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Adams-Gillstrom, Karl</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Over the past few decades, functional magnetorheological (MR) materials have been extensively researched due to their field-dependent adaptive mechanical properties, which hold substantial promise for implementing semi-active vibration control across various engineering applications. MR elastomers (MRE) are the solid analogue of well-known MR fluids (MRF), where micron-sized ferromagnetic particles are integrated within an elastomeric medium rather than a carrier fluid. In contrast to MRFs, which provide field-dependent variable damping properties, MREs exhibit adjustable stiffness and damping characteristics. MREs also do not experience the sedimentation of magnetic particles and leakage often encountered in MRF-based systems. 
While there are several studies related to the characterization of MREs operating in shear mode under varying mechanical and magnetic excitation conditions, there are very few studies on the characterization of MREs under compression mode. In particular, the characterization of hybrid MREs, in which MRF is encapsulated within MREs, has been rarely investigated.
The objective of the present research is to systematically characterize and compare the viscoelastic properties and dynamic behavior of MREs, MRF-Es (where MR fluid is encapsulated within an elastomeric matrix), and new hybrid MRF-MREs (where MR fluid is encapsulated within MREs), considering the effects of design factors (i.e., shape factor and shape) and mechanical and magnetic loading conditions. To accomplish this, eight different samples of MREs, MRF-Es, and MRF-MREs were fabricated. Dynamic characterization was performed in compression mode under harmonic excitations with varying strain amplitude, frequency, and applied current, ranging from (2.5% to 15%), (0.088 Hz to 10 Hz), and (0 A to 8 A), respectively. Results suggested superior performance of MRF-MREs, exhibiting a relative MR effect of nearly 478%, almost three times that of its counterpart, the MRF-E, and surpassing the MRE by a factor of ten under identical loading conditions. 
Finally, a phenomenological model was developed based on the modified viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt model to predict the viscoelastic storage and loss moduli of MREs, MRF-Es, and MRF-MREs as functions of frequency, strain amplitude, and current. The developed model was subsequently used to derive the transmissibility response of an adaptive single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system to investigate its capability to tune the natural frequency. An experimental test setup was also designed to confirm the variation in natural frequency of the SDOF system under varying current.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Detection, Identification and Isolation of Cyber-Attacks using Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory in Single and Network of Quadcopters</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Afshar, Erfan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems (CPS), particularly quadcopters, is critical due to their reliance on communication networks, which makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This thesis addresses the security of quadcopters by introducing a novel framework for the simultaneous detection, identification, and isolation of cyber-attacks using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Unlike previous research that primarily focuses on detection, this work advances the field by integrating attack type identification and target isolation, enhancing overall security capabilities.
A contribution of this thesis is the emphasis on sequence generation as a pre-processing step for time-series data in LSTM models. By optimizing sequence length, overlap, and labeling methods, the proposed approach ensures the effective capture of temporal dependencies, substantially improving model performance for attack detection, identification, and isolation.
The study introduces a novel multi-output (MO) model for single quadcopters, utilizing a shared LSTM backbone with three output heads. This framework is extended to a network of quadcopters through a Multi-Input, Multi-Output (MIMO) architecture, which incorporates a flexible number of input heads for each quadcopter, enhancing scalability. The model supports both centralized and decentralized topologies, accommodating networks of varying sizes, ranging from 2 to 5 quadcopters.
Simulation results for Denial of Service (DoS), False Data Injection (FDI), and Replay attacks demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework. The single quadcopter model achieved over 95% accuracy in attack detection, along with high precision in identifying attack types and locations. In networked setups, the centralized MIMO model delivered superior performance, while the decentralized approach also yielded promising results. These findings highlight the adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed approaches, paving the way for broader CPS applications and further advancements in sequence generation techniques.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A First Principles Study on The Effect of Hydrogen on The Electrical Properties of BCC Fe</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ahmad, Muhammad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Iron (Fe) and iron-carbon (Fe-C) materials, used in various critical industrial applications, are susceptible to Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) – a phenomenon leading to increased crack growth rate, reduced ductility, and potentially leading to catastrophic material failure. The intricate mechanisms underpinning HE demand comprehensive scrutiny. A pivotal aspect often overlooked is how hydrogen assimilation in these materials induces alterations in specific physical attributes, notably electrical resistivity. Addressing this gap, the study employs Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the MD-Landauer method to delve into the influence of hydrogen on the electrical characteristics of Fe and Fe-C systems. The study shows that the presence of interstitial hydrogen increases the resistivity of Fe and Fe-C systems. Hydrogen is seen to reduce the likelihood of electron transmission in the system by disrupting the electron density distribution. This introduces a noteworthy increase in resistivity with hydrogen incorporation. Moreover, the presence of defects, like vacancies and grain boundaries, is shown to increase the resistivity of these systems. Adding hydrogen along with these defects further increases the resistivity. Studying the effects of hydrogen on the physical properties of metals may pave the way for non-destructive detection of hydrogen presence in metals. Such understanding is crucial for enhancing quality control, ensuring material longevity, and preventing potential failures during manufacturing processes or in-service.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>District cooling offers an energy-efficient solution for hot urban regions where cooling demands are high. Accurate and rapid predictions of cooling requirements are vital during the planning phase to support informed decision-making. Surrogate models, which combine physics-based simulations with statistical or machine learning techniques, can harness the strengths of both methods, leading to more accurate building energy predictions at a low computational cost. In this study, a surrogate model, which combines machine learning with building physics-based archetypes, is employed to predict the cooling energy use intensities for high-rise buildings in a mixed-use district. The proposed surrogate models predict the impact of building design parameters, building operation characteristics, and occupant-related parameters on building energy performance. High-rise building models, representative of the district, are created using EnergyPlus software. The detailed cooling load profiles of these baseline models are simulated, analyzed, and validated against measured data and literature benchmarks. The resulting cooling loads are then aggregated at the district level, providing a physics-based method for urban-scale energy prediction. Parametric simulations are automated in RStudio using the developed archetypes by altering key parameters such as building envelope characteristics, geometry, and operational parameters, including occupant behavior. The resulting datasets are used to train machine learning models to approximate the outcomes of physics-based simulations. Additionally, the trained models are integrated into a user-friendly interface, enabling computationally efficient predictions of cooling requirements for each building in the district. The developed models show excellent performance, with R² values near 1 and RMSE below 0.17 kWh/m²/month on unseen data. This study demonstrates the potential of surrogate machine learning in predicting and optimizing building energy performance under different design, operation, and occupancy settings. It also provides insights into the impact of training dataset size on the accuracy of surrogate machine learning models.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Development and Implementation of Deep Learning Algorithms for Restoring Images Degraded by JPEG Compression</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ahsan, Syed Safwan Sajjad Rakib</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>JPEG is one of the most popular image compression techniques in the world. Its effectiveness has led to it being used in diverse sectors such as satellite imaging, medical imaging, image storage systems and multimedia. With the diverse use of JPEG compression algorithms, it has also become necessary to develop deblocking algorithms to mitigate the compression loss caused by the compression. With the advent of deep learning, several
methods have been developed for JPEG image deblocking. The quality factor or QF value is vital to the compression process. Most deep JPEG deblocking networks face the challenge of requiring the image to be compressed by a QF value which is part of the training
process. If the image is compressed by any other QF value, the performance and deblocking quality of the network severely degrades.
In this thesis, two different schemes are proposed to solve this issue. The first proposed scheme aims to tackle the problem from the out-of-distribution point of view, whereas the
second proposed network aims to tackle the problem from a meta-learning point of view. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated by conducting experiments employing two different benchmark datasets. The proposed networks are shown to outperform the state-of-the-art deep JPEG deblocking networks as shown by the quantitative and qualitative comparative studies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Ajavon, Kylian Yoan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Graphs provide a powerful abstraction for modeling real-world systems, such as social and transportation networks. Of particular significance is the study of diffusion processes on graphs, which is crucial to disciplines spanning biology, engineering and computer science, and to the understanding of phenomena such as disease propagation or the flux of goods and/or people through a transportation network. In this work, we formulate the solution of the diffusion equation on graphs as a parametric model, which gives us insight into the behavior of the diffusion processes by studying how the diffusivity parameters influence the model output. However, accurately simulating the model output of these diffusion processes can be computationally demanding since it involves solving large systems of ordinary differential equations.
To address this challenge, we propose to construct surrogate models able to approximate the state of a graph at a given time from the knowledge of the diffusivity parameters. In particular, we consider recently introduced techniques from high-dimensional approximation based on sparse polynomial expansions, which are known to produce accurate and sample-efficient approximations when the function to be approximated has holomorphic regularity. Hence, to justify our methodology, we present theoretical results showing that solution maps resulting from a certain class of parametric graph diffusion processes are holomorphic. Then, we demonstrate numerically that it is possible to efficiently compute accurate sparse polynomial surrogate models from a few random samples, hence empirically showing the validity of our approach.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Impact noise reduction in cross laminated timber by embedding acoustic black holes</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Akinpelu, Temitope</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The widespread adoption of cross-laminated timber (CLT) in building construction faces challenges, especially concerning low-frequency impact noise. Conventional methods for addressing this issue requires thick floor assemblies. This study suggests embedding acoustic black holes (ABH) into CLT floors as an alternative solution.

Functioning as a wave guide, the ABH concentrates energy in specific regions where it is absorbed by the damper. The finite-element method is used to analyze the vibro-acoustic response of CLT plates embedded with a periodic grid of ABH indentations (ABH-CLT). The goal is to evaluate the influence of the outer radius, number of indentations, and structural damping on the vibro-acoustic response within 50-800 Hz and assess reduction in radiated sound power.

The structural response shows that including ABH in CLT floors leads to unintended resonance frequencies. However, characterizing these changes is challenging due to other influential variables. Likewise, varying the number of indentations does not show a clear trend in radiated sound power at a loss factor of 0.03. However, with a higher loss factor (0.2), the trend favors maximizing the indentations. 

Increasing the outer radius shifts the structural response to lower frequencies, but the acoustic response remains unpredictable at a loss factor of 0.03, suggesting that the amount of damping is more influential this frequency range.

In the third-octave band, ABH-CLT consistently attenuates sound power levels at higher frequencies above 400 Hz, which is equally achievable by damping a CLT without ABH. However, the ABH is not effective in mitigating impact noise below 400 Hz.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Al-Shami, Forcan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Traditional language classrooms often face constraints that limit ESL learners’ exposure to varied speech sounds, hindering their pronunciation development. High-Variability Phonetic Training (HVPT) offers a potential solution by exposing learners in diverse speech sounds and accents to improve pronunciation skills. However, the practical implementation of HVPT in everyday language classrooms is still underexplored. This study examines the integration of Text-To-Speech (TTS) technology with HVPT to enhance pronunciation skills among English as a Second Language (ESL) learners beyond traditional classroom settings.
Using a mixed-method design with pretest-posttest evaluations, this study assessed morphophonemic features (past -ed allomorphs) and holistic aspects of pronunciation (i.e., comprehensibility, accentedness). Thirty adult university-level ESL learners from Kuwait were assigned to either a Treatment group (TTS with varied voices) or a Control group (TTS with a single voice). Participants engaged in self-paced sessions over a period of four weeks.
The results revealed significant improvements in phonological awareness of past -ed allomorphy for both groups, with no notable differences observed between them. In terms of the holistic measures of pronunciation development, evaluated by a panel of eleven raters, the Treatment group achieved statistically significant improvements in both comprehensibility and accentedness when compared to the Control group. These findings indicate that while TTS technology enhances phonological awareness irrespective of HVPT implementation, TTS-based HVPT further enhances pronunciation development considering the two holistic measures adopted.
This study highlights the potential of TTS technology to provide variable aural input and improve ESL pronunciation training, offering valuable insights for developing effective and accessible language learning resources.</etd_ms:description>

over Virtual Machines</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The advent of 5G and the imminent arrival of Beyond 5G (B5G) have significantly increased demands on service providers. This exponential growth poses a challenge for 5G networks, since clients are currently offloading data to edge cloud servers to meet the connectivity and latency requirements. These servers must continually scale to meet increasing demands for CPU, memory, and storage, leading to significant energy consumption. Data centers account for 1.5% of global energy consumption and produce equally high greenhouse gas emissions. This trend will grow unless we find ways to improve efficiency. Our work proposes a solution to these problems with an efficient placement algorithm backed by an accurate energy predictive model. This model helps by pre-emptively detecting the energy each machine will consume when future tasks are deployed. These predictive
capabilities help the placement and reduce overall energy consumption. Our model uses Performance Monitoring Counters and various sensors, such as heat and fan speed, commonly found on Data Center machines, to increase its feature space and accuracy. Our work
includes creating the model and integrating it with the energy-aware placement algorithm. Additionally, our method increased the performance and overall Quality of Service. Our results show that our machine learning model, particularly using XGBoost, can reduce energy consumption and improve task completion times in realistic scenarios. Our experiments, tested on real servers with realistic loads, achieved good results without using stresses like stress-ng that generate unrealistic loads. Our model achieved an R2 score of 91.2%, helping reduce energy consumption by 6% without changes to the cluster or the
need for consolidation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Novel Deep Learning Techniques for the Detection and Classification of Neurodegenerative Diseases using Resting State Electroencephalography</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Neurodegenerative diseases are debilitating conditions that progressively deteriorate the life quality of those affected. Compared with traditional neuroimaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Electroencephalography (EEG) can provide a more cost-effective and accessible alternative to help underprivileged populations obtain an early diagnosis of their condition, which is paramount for effective patient care. Resting-state EEG (rs-EEG), which records signals while a subject is at rest, offers an alternative to the commonly used task-based experiments for easier-to-adopt data acquisition protocols. While deep learning techniques have been shown to be effective for automatically classifying most EEG signals, they struggle with modeling the longrange temporal dependencies, complex spatial relationships, and the lack of time-locked events in rs-EEG. Aiming to address these issues, we first propose an explainable Graph Neural Network technique for rs-EEG-based Parkinson’s disease detection. Our method uses structured global convolutions to model long-range dependencies and novel multi-head graph structure learning to capture the complex spatial relationships in EEG data. We also propose a head-wise gradient-weighted graph attention explainer to obtain rich connectivity insights. Our second major contribution leverages recent innovations in state space modeling techniques to classify individuals with dementia, and we explore spectral and spatial approaches for learning relationships between EEG channels for the designated task. Additionally, we probe our model’s outputs with explainability techniques and demonstrate that our model learns physiologically relevant features. This thesis puts forth novel deep-learning methods that show promise in addressing challenges in neurodegenerative disease classification using rs-EEG.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Concussions present a significant risk to athletes, with females exhibiting higher rates and prolonged recovery times than males. Current sideline concussion detection methods, such as the King-Devick test, suffer from validity issues, especially among young athletes, highlighting the need for more accurate and objective assessment tools. This study investigates the feasibility of using pose estimation technology, specifically Microsoft Kinect V2, to assess postural stability in varsity athletes with a concussion history. Inspired by previous research utilizing force plates, our study analyzes video recordings of athletes performing specific exercises to detect dynamic balance deficits. In a cross-sectional study of 444 varsity athletes in 2022 and 464 varsity athletes in 2023, results reveal significant differences in movement mechanics between concussed and control groups, with the Drop Vertical Jump (DVJ) exercise demonstrating the highest discriminatory power. Notably, concussed individuals exhibit longer time to stabilization (mean difference = 0.089 seconds, p = 0.046) during DVJ, indicating potential lingering balance impairments. While single leg squat and single leg hop exercises showed fewer discriminatory metrics than DVJ, they still provide valuable insights into balance capabilities. The DVJ was the most effective at distinguishing between injured and healthy male athletes, while the SLH was more effective for females and the SLS was equally ineffective for both males and females. Our research also studied 20 varsity athletes who sustained one or many concussions from 2022 to 2023 and compared their DVJ exercise metrics before and after injury. The results of this prospective study demonstrated few statistically significant differences between their 2022 and 2023 jumps for all computed metrics, suggesting that the occurrence of concussion(s) did not have a significant measurable impact on the athletes' jumping mechanics or dynamic balance for the DVJ over this period.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis is a study on the broadcasting problem in various graph topologies containing intersecting cliques. Broadcasting, is a fundamental message dissemination problem in interconnection networks, requiring an informed originator node to distribute information to all network nodes efficiently. Determination of the broadcast time of any node in an arbitrary network is known to be NP-hard. Polynomial time solutions are known only for a few network topologies. There also exist various heuristic and approximation algorithms for different network topologies. The work in this thesis addresses this challenge through the development and enhancement of algorithms tailored to specific graph structures such as windmill graphs, star of cliques, path-connected cliques, fully connected cliques, and block graphs.

Chapter 3 studies the broadcasting problem in windmill graphs and stars of cliques. A windmill graph is defined on $n$ vertices containing $k$ cliques of size $l$, and a universal vertex. We present a constant time method introduced for determining the broadcast time of an arbitrary node in any windmill graph. We also introduce \textit{Star of Cliques}, a generalization of the Windmill graph composed of cliques with arbitrary sizes. We study the importance of unaddressed vertices in an optimal scheme for star of cliques and show the use of binary representations to track unaddressed vertices. We present an $O(n \cdot \log n)$ algorithm to find the broadcast time of any vertex in an arbitrary star of cliques and discuss the optimality of our algorithm.

Chapter 4 delves into broadcasting within families of block graphs, such as path-connected cliques and fully connected cliques. Every biconnected component in a block graph is a clique. We study broadcasting in block graphs with two cliques, present a constant time method to calculate the broadcast time for an arbitrary path-connected cliques graph, and discuss a $O(n \log\log s_{center})$ method to determine the broadcast time for arbitrary fully connected cliques, where $s_{center}$ is the number of vertices in the central clique of the graph.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>I am drawn to the nature of routine as a means to understand trauma. A shift in habit can inform, or be informed by, a parallel change in psyche. What can our routines, in the days that follow assault/diagnosis/heartbreak/etc. tell us on a larger scale? How do our spaces, in turn, reflect these changes? I believe that the objects and practices which occupy a space are in direct correlation with the process of living with grief. A poem has the power to float or pace across the page: taking ownership of a space, or compressing itself neatly into a corner. As such, this genre is particularly apt for the work of embodying how spatiality plays into the process of attempting to overcome harm. The project approaches the above through both the poetic form and fiber arts pieces interspersed throughout the project, which serve as evidence of the speaker’s strained relationship with written expression, and their shifting coping mechanisms. The speaker in these poems is concerned with remembering. Snippets of past conversations, visited spaces, and half-baked memories ebb and flow throughout the piece as the seasons carry forward. There is a disconnect between the passage of time and the speaker’s desire to rest at “checkpoints” of certainty in the brain. Ultimately, the thesis concerns itself with healing by actively centering these poems in the body and space.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Testimonial Injustice in Witch Trials: A Case Against Fricker’s Prejudice Hypothesis</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this paper, I intend to enrich or go beyond what I call the Prejudice Hypothesis, which says prejudice is the main cause of testimonial injustice. By ‘a main cause of testimonial injustice’,
I mean something that is among the significant causes of testimonial injustice and which, following Fricker, may be what she calls a ‘culpable’ cause, the source of which, whether individuals or structure of individuals, can appropriately be assigned epistemic and ethical blame. To enrich or go beyond the Prejudice Hypothesis, I will argue for increased recognition and investigation of another cause of testimonial injustice: the pursuit and protection of social order. According to my Social Order Hypothesis, desires or attempts to pursue or preserve the dominant social order are often among the significant causes of testimonial injustice. Although in some cases these social order causes appear to interact importantly with prejudice in the production of testimonial injustice, we will also consider cases in which social order causes work independently of any prejudice. Insofar as current literature on testimonial injustice presupposes the Prejudice Hypothesis, it overlooks these roles played by social order causes and more attention to examination of such causes would help remedy this and improve our understanding of testimonial injustice. It would also better position us to investigate when social order causes are culpable causes in Fricker’s sense.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Optimal Allocation of EVs in Electricity Distribution Network to Maintain Uniform Load</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Arabi, Marziehsadat</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>An electricity distribution network comprises of parking lots, electric vehicles, distribution grid, transformers, charging infrastructure, and customer locations. This thesis presents an optimization model for the optimal allocation of parking lots within a distribution system to efficiently supply electric vehicle (EV) loads. The model aims to determine the best capacity and size of parking lots to meet peak hour demands while considering constraints on the permanent operation of the distribution system. Using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, the study maximizes total benefits, taking into account data and market prices. Results show that installing parking lots could be economically profitable for distribution companies (DISCOs) and could improve voltage profiles.
The study also explores the impact of battery capacity and charging power rate variations on outcomes, emphasizing the importance of accurately determining these parameters. Additionally, the study highlights the advantages of the proposed approach, including improvements in voltage profiles, reductions in power flow, and enhancements in equipment lifespan. These benefits underscore the potential of the approach to optimize parking lot allocations for EV charging and improve overall distribution network performance and efficiency. Further implementation in suitable locations with appropriate sizes could yield significant technical and financial benefits.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Quelle place occupe la langue dans l’identité nationale québécoise? Depuis des siècles, la province francophone martèle l’importance de sa culture distincte au reste du Canada et la langue en est sa manifestation la plus saillante, voire la plus fondamentale. Pour cette raison, les politiques publiques qui visent à défendre la langue sont bien établies dans le paysage politique québécois. Ceci dit, on en sait très peu sur l’importance qu’accordent les membres du groupe majoritaire à cette caractéristique. Et force est d’admettre qu’on en sait encore moins au sujet de l’accent québécois, bien qu’il soit un marqueur d’altérité depuis que le Québec accueille un nombre grandissant d’immigrants à la suite de la Révolution tranquille. Ce mémoire démontre que l’accent québécois est une composante importante de la construction de l’identité nationale, mais que la langue française est bien plus importante dans cette construction. De plus, nous révélons que les ramifications de la langue et de l’accent sur les attitudes envers l’immigration sont différentes. Alors que celles de l’accent québécois sont exclusives, celles de la langue française sont parfois exclusives et d’autres fois inclusives, ce qui atteste de l’ambiguïté entourant le rôle de la langue dans la construction de l’identité nationale.	 La recherche repose sur un sondage réalisé au Québec en ligne en 2022 auprès de 2 401 personnes du groupe majoritaire (nés au Canada, non-membre d’une minorité visible ni autochtone, dont la langue maternelle est le français).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this study, we propose a novel approach to multi-label classification of chest X-ray (CXR) images that prioritizes clinical interpretability while maintaining the efficiency of a streamlined, single-model, single-run training pipeline. Using the CheXpert dataset and VisualCheXbert-derived labels, we introduce hierarchical label groupings to reflect clinically meaningful relationships among diseases. To implement this, we developed a custom hierarchical binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function that enforces label dependencies through fixed or data-driven penalty mechanisms. This approach aims to preserve diagnostic accuracy while producing structured and clinically coherent predictions.

        <etd_ms:title>Beyond Dichotomies: Identifying Alcohol and Cannabis Co-use Patterns Across Gender Through Tests of Predictive and Explanatory Similarity in Emerging Adults</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Asuncion, Toni-Rose D.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>co-use, impulsivity, gender, negative consequences</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Emerging adulthood is a developmental period marked by increased risky behaviours, including alcohol and cannabis co-use (AC co-use). AC co-use is associated with more health and occupation-related negative consequences compared to the isolated use of any one of these substances. Several studies examine co-use as a dichotomy (i.e., whether someone co-uses or not), which limits our understanding of the heterogeneity of co-use profiles and its impact on negative consequences. Furthermore, given emerging evidence supporting gender differences in negative consequences experienced specific to AC co-use, it is critical to consider how gender may influence the nature of emerging adult co-use profiles, determinants, and consequences. The present study addresses these limitations by pursuing three core objectives: (i) identify single and co-use patterns across gender; (ii) examine personality factors (i.e., impulsivity) as a predictor of patterns; (iii) link patterns with negative consequences to measure risk. This online study included 468 first-year undergraduate participants who completed measures of alcohol and cannabis quantity and frequency of use, impulsivity, and negative consequences for both alcohol and cannabis use. Latent profile analyses revealed four AC co-use patterns. Two were identical across gender: Profile 1 – Heavy Alcohol Single Use and Elevated Alcohol Co-Use and Profile 2 – Primarily Moderate Alcohol Single Use. Profile 4 (Light AC Single Use and Elevated Alcohol Co-Use) was also highly similar across genders. However, gender-diverse individuals and women tended to use and co-use cannabis to a greater extent than men. In contrast, Profile 3 differed in women relative to men and gender-diverse individuals. Indeed, women in this profile primarily heavily use alcohol on co-use days (Primarily Heavy Alcohol Co-Users); men and gender-diverse individuals displayed a more problematic pattern (Heavy Cannabis Single Use and Elevated Alcohol Co-Use) involving heavy use and co-use of cannabis, coupled with a heavy co-use of alcohol. Interestingly, however, predictions and outcomes generalized across genders, suggesting that despite these differences in patterns, these profiles seem to capture similar psychological mechanisms. Consistent with our hypotheses, two facets of impulsivity (i.e., negative urgency and sensation-seeking) predicted risky AC co-use patterns. However, another facet (positive urgency) was related to less problematic AC co-use patterns. More negative consequences were associated with the heaviest co-use pattern (i.e., Profile 3). Unexpectedly, Profile 4 (also displaying high AC co-use) was associated with a similarly high level of negative consequences. Profile 1 (dominated by alcohol use and co-use) also had a similar level of alcohol-related negative consequences as Profiles 3 and 4. Our findings add meaningful implications and improve refined measurement of AC co-use. Furthermore, this study has contributed to risk model etiology which will further the literature and have clinical implications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Microstructural, Mechanical and Tribological Investigation of Copper-Based Coatings for Extreme Environments.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Asuquo, Martin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Thermal spray coating methods such as Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS), High-Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF), and newly developed High-Velocity Air Fuel (HVAF) offer one of the best technique to effectively protect new parts from high temperature, wear, corrosion, and residual stresses as well as produce hard and dense coatings which in turn helps in the improvement of the lifespan of the material. These techniques provide coatings that enable the enhancement and prolongment of component life and the reduction of component cost due to the improvement in the functionality of a low-cost material. There is also an opportunity to revamp worn parts to their original dimensions, without the need to replace the entire component. However, traditional thermal spray techniques tend to produce coatings with high oxide content and porosity resulting in undesirable coating properties. On the other hand, Cold Spray (CS), a more recent coating technique, can produce highly dense coatings with strong bonding through the plastic deformation of powder feedstock, thus avoiding most of the aforementioned issues.

The main purpose of this research is to study the tribological properties of copper-based coatings deposited by APS, HVAF and Cold spray (i.e. from high temperature to low temperature deposition methods) to determine their suitability for extreme environments.  This thesis is comprised of two research studies, The first study emphasizes on development of APS-CuNi coatings on different substrate materials to investigate the influence of the substrate materials as well as the tribological performance of the coatings at various temperatures (room and elevated temperature). The second study focuses on the evaluation of copper coatings by low temperature deposition systems (HVAF and CS) to understand their microstructural, mechanical and tribological behavior (room and elevated temperature). 

The microstructural evaluation of coatings produced by both studies was analysed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Also, the Vickers microhardness tester was used to measure the coatings hardness in both studies. Furthermore, the tribological performance of coatings developed in both studies was conducted with a reciprocating tribometer using a ball-on-flat configuration and wear profiles were measured using confocal laser microscopy. Ex-situ characterization of the worn coatings was performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Raman spectroscopy. In the first study, APS coatings showed lower wear rates at room temperature in comparison to high temperature sliding. With regards to the second study, cold sprayed copper coatings showed a better wear resistance compared to the HVAF copper coatings.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Brand storytelling is considered an important contributor to brand success. Stories are known to narratively transport the audience, which results in positive brand outcomes. Past research on narrative transportation mainly focused on presenting stories in a written form. 
However, aside from text, brands can communicate to consumers via different mediums (e.g., video). The impact of different mediums on the experience of narrative transportation has received little attention in the literature. This research aims to explore whether the amount of narrative 
transportation could vary across different mediums of storytelling, specifically text vs. video. Additionally, this research aims to understand the underlying mechanism for why narrative transportation may differ across mediums. Specifically, I theorize that a story presented via text 
may require a different amount of cognitive resources to process compared to a story presented via video form, which may affect the amount of narrative transportation experienced. This thesis 
examines these questions across three studies. Study 1 found that presenting a story in text form led to significantly higher narrative transportation compared to presenting the story in video form. 
Study 2 results were consistent with study 1 and additionally demonstrated that text required more cognitive resources to process compared to video. However, the cognitive resource requirement 
did not ultimately mediate the effect of medium on narrative transportation. Study 3 aimed to test the mechanism by manipulating cognitive load. While the effect of medium was replicated, cognitive load did not moderate this main effect. Finally, theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Through a methodology of research-creation, this thesis explains how an environmental practice consisting of growing, foraging, and harvesting indigenous plants of North America, primarily milkweed, can translate into an environmental art education within the classroom. It describes the path an art educator and textile artist walked to expose readers to elements of the outdoors, and suggests paths to take to proactively embody environmental practices. It asks: “How can she establish a sustaining environmental art education?’’ With themes of Canadian identity, epistemology, reciprocity, deep ecology, and environmental conservatism, the artist and educator walks the readers through steps of papermaking with milkweed seed pod fibre grown and harvested locally.

À travers une méthodologie de recherche-création, ce mémoire explique comment une pratique environnementale constituant de faire pousser, de récolter, et de cueillir des plantes indigènes de l’Amérique du Nord, principalement l’asclépiade, se traduit en une éducation des arts environnementale au sein d’une classe. Ça décrit le chemin qu’une éducatrice des arts et une artiste textile a pris afin d’exposé les lecteurs aux éléments de la nature, et suggère des voies à prendre de manière proactive en lieu d’incarner des pratiques environnementales. Ça demande: “Comment peut-elle établir une éducation des arts environnementale soutenable?’’ Par des thèmes d’identité canadienne, d’épistémologie, de réciprocité, d’écologie profonde, et de conservatisme environnemental, l’artiste et éducatrice mène les lecteurs au travers des démarches de la fabrication de papier en utilisant la fibre contenue dans les cocons de graines d’asclépiade poussé et récolté localement.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Automated Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Light Commercial Building’s HVAC systems</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in commercial buildings' HVAC systems can significantly reduce energy consumption. Faults in these systems occur due to various issues such as aging and inadequate maintenance. Commercial buildings in Canada covered an area of 709,029,612 m² in 2019, consuming 948,216,746 GJ of energy. HVAC systems are responsible for 25%-50% of this energy consumption. In the United States, faults in HVAC systems contribute to an additional energy consumption of 103 to 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) in the building sector. Detecting and diagnosing faults in HVAC systems can reduce energy consumption by 20% to 30%.  Light commercial buildings, defined as commercial buildings with fewer than six stories and less than 2500 square feet, include bank branches, offices, and small industrial facilities. These buildings have similarities in the configuration and size of HVAC components, making it feasible to develop an FDD tailored for this class of buildings, that can be easily scaled up. This goal can be achieved using data-driven methods, which have gained popularity over the past decades by installing various sensors and collecting data integrated with Building Energy Management (BEM) systems. In this thesis, three different FDD methods have been developed and validated on light commercial buildings. The first method is a semi-supervised method that includes various techniques to handle the unlabeled raw data from BEMs, resulting in a final supervised Automatic Fault Detection (AFDD) system. The second method is a fully unsupervised novel AFDD method based on PCA time series fault detection. The third method is primarily based on the inverse model of the Air Handling Unit (AHU) of the HVAC systems.  A typical light commercial building in Montreal, Canada, was used for all methods. Additionally, to validate the generalizability of the unsupervised method, another light commercial building, a small industrial facility in Ireland, was used as well. The first method successfully resulted in an AFDD that can detect and diagnose faults with almost 90% accuracy, performing better in condition-based faults than control faults. The unsupervised method showed very good results in terms of generalizability. It was able to detect faults and report the problematic inputs and locations to the HVAC operators. Although the unsupervised method cannot completely diagnose condition-based faults, it provides very good information based on the system's behavior, enabling operators to diagnose the faults. Finally, the inverse modeling revealed that a physics-based neural network can outperform neural networks and genetic algorithms in modeling the system inversely and detecting anomalies mostly related to energy consumption.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>De nombreuses recherches ont été effectuées sur le trauma et ses conséquences sur le développement des enfants. Le trauma peut atteindre directement leur quotidien, mais aussi la relation de confiance avec l’adulte. La musicothérapie peut être bénéfique pour les enfants ayant un diagnostic de trauma complexe en offrant des approches et interventions personnalisées dont le Trauma-Informed Music Therapy (TIMT). Cependant, il existe peu de recherches dans cette spécialisation en comparaison avec les autres domaines professionnels en santé mentale. Ce mémoire décrit l’état de la littérature scientifique entre 2017 et 2023 sur les interventions priorisées en musicothérapie auprès d'enfants de 6 à 12 ans ayant vécu des traumas complexes. Pour ce faire, la recherche dans ce domaine a été répertoriée à l'aide d'une méthodologie de revue exploratoire. La littérature a été analysée et synthétisée dans le but de recenser les informations les plus récentes sur le sujet. Les résultats ont démontré qu’il y avait peu de recherche sur la musicothérapie auprès des enfants ayant vécu des traumas complexes et qu'il existerait un lien entre le manque d’études sur ce sujet et le peu de musicothérapeutes se spécialisant dans ce domaine. Les limites de la recherche et implications pour la recherche, la pratique, la formation et la justice sociale sont présentées.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The effects of front-of-package warning labels on consumer attitudes and purchase intentions toward reformulated food products</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Baczynski, Jakub</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>To address the growing concern of non-communicable diseases and obesity, the Government of Canada will introduce a mandatory front-of-package (FOP) warning label for prepackaged foods “high in” saturated fats, sugars, and sodium. This intervention, set to be implemented in January 2026, aims to nudge consumers into making better-informed and healthier food choices. Through a series of three experimental studies, this research seeks to examine: (1) the influence of the proposed FOP label on consumer attitudes and purchase intentions toward reformulated products; (2) the mediating effects of perceived healthiness and perceived tastiness; and (3) the moderating roles of goal salience (health vs. indulgence) and product type (healthy vs. unhealthy). Study 1 found that warning labels led to declining consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions toward reformulated products, with perceived healthiness mediating the effect. Study 2 revealed that participants with a prominent health goal exhibited less favorable attitudes toward the reformulated product with (vs. without) the warning label, while those with an indulgent goal showed no difference in attitudes. Study 3 showed that participants demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the warning label when displayed on healthy (vs. unhealthy) food products. This thesis contributes to the literature on consumer behavior in the food industry, offering insights into the dynamics between health and indulgence within the framework of warning labels and product reformulation. The findings hold managerial implications for new product development, packaging, and communication strategies, and can help inform governments and policymakers about the effectiveness of warning labels for reformulated products.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has been the center of attention in the past decades. Developing methodologies to detect or estimate cyber-attacks on sensor measurements
and actuator inputs is essential for ensuring the safe and reliable performance of these interconnected systems of systems. Considering the stealthy nature of cyber-attacks, combined with potential faults, additional challenges emerge, which this thesis addresses through the lens of control theory.

In control theory, several methodologies have addressed the decoupling of unknown inputs, such as faults and disturbances. However, the simultaneous presence of faults and cyber-attacks
presents challenges that are not fully developed in the context of CPS. The first part of this thesis proposes a methodology, consisting of the construction of two plant-side monitoring filters to detect and isolate faults and cyber-attacks including covert and zero dynamic attacks. The findings are supported through analytical and simulation studies.

As the second challenge, a multi-rate approach is employed to estimate actuator cyber-attacks in the presence of sensors and actuators faults in CPS. A plant-side fault monitoring filter is
augmented with the physical system, and its residual, along with the plant’s outputs, is sent to C&amp;C with a specified mechanism. Cyber-attacks are isolated from faults through the received
information in the C&amp;C and a secondary observer. Consequently, a delayed Unknown Input Observer (UIO) is constructed to estimate the actuator cyber-attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed
methodology is evaluated through numerical case studies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Hegel, Modernity, Crisis, Dialectics, Entzweiung</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper attempts to understand the young Hegel’s diagnosis of modernity as a singularly distinctive event, proposing that modernity inaugurates a new historical epoch characterized by a state of permanent crisis. The young Hegel saw modernity as a process of detachment from the past, producing a rupture in which the role of subjectivity takes on a twofold manifestation, as subjective freedom and as reflection. Although Hegel recognized the immense historical importance of the modern concept of freedom, he also argued that subjectivity is a one-sided principle, triggering the split [Entzweiung] between the individual and the whole. In my interpretation of the young Hegel, Entzweiung spreads itself through all spheres of culture and social life, forming many divisions and dualisms, which appear fixed in their oppositions, becoming unsolvable contradictions due to the reflective activity of the Understanding [Verstand]. The proliferation of contradictions in all spheres of social life constitutes what I call a state of permanent crisis, a deeply fractured totality, unable to reach a resolution [Entschluss] to its inherent negativity, giving rise to a melancholic longing and striving for reconciliation. Finally, I will defend the hypothesis that Hegel's solution to the state of crisis, inaugurated by the advent of modernity is none other than the formulation of his dialectical method, thus claiming that implied in Hegel’s philosophy is an implicit notion of philosophy for times of crisis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring TikTok’s Potential as a Platform for Valuable Journalism</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Barile, Jessica</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>News organizations have begun incorporating the social media app TikTok as one of the many platforms they post their content to. In Canada, since the passing of the Online News Act (Bill C-18) in summer 2023, Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, has blocked Canadian news outlets from posting content on their platforms, leading many to turn to TikTok to reach audiences on social media. The app's popularity and lack of transparency raise questions about whether valuable journalism could be possible on the app. This research-creation thesis uses Irene Costera Meijer's (2022) "valuable journalism" concept, which describes three experiences that may lead individuals to feel a sense of value towards a news story: (1) getting recognition, (2) increasing mutual understanding, and (3) learning something new. Guided by these concepts, this research analyzes three Canadian commercial mainstream news outlets’ TikTok accounts—namely CTV News, Global News, and CityNews Toronto—to explore whether their content exhibits elements of these "valuable journalism" experience. The total number of TikTok videos analyzed in this research is 542 across all three news outlets' TikTok accounts between August 11 and November 11, 2023. The results show a progressive use of TikTok and overall evidence of valuable experiences according to Costera Meijer's concepts, but also suggests more can be done to creatively produce news on the app using its tailored tools, and to reach audiences in valuable ways. These findings helped inform the creation of three original TikTok videos that each seek to demonstrate the elements of Costera Meijer's three valuable news experiences, to bridge these theoretical aspects to practical elements of journalism production for social media.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>That determinism occupies an integral place within apocalypticism’s notional architecture is routinely acknowledged in scholarship. However, examinations of determinism’s conceptual structure and function within Jewish and early Christian apocalypticism are lacking. Moreover, where determinism has been treated within this context, it is frequently framed by the language and definitional constructs of contemporary philosophical and popular discourse. The effect of this approach is to obscure the conceptual coherence which underlies the texts.
In light of this gap in scholarship, I examine determinism and human moral agency within four Jewish historical apocalypses: the biblical book of Daniel chaps. 7-12, The Animal Apocalypse, 4 Ezra, and 2 Baruch. This analysis eschews the framework of contemporary philosophical and popular discourse in an effort to understand the way in which apocalyptic determinism coheres with conceptualizations of human moral agency within the texts themselves. From this analysis, it is my contention that: 1) a stable, conceptual core of an “early Jewish apocalyptic determinism” persists across the four apocalypses, which together correspond to a period of approximately 300 years; 2) 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch reflect two distinct developmental directions for “early Jewish apocalyptic determinism;” and 3) across the four apocalypses, “early Jewish apocalyptic determinism” contributes to the texts’ social function in a consistent manner.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Detecting Collusion in Public Procurement:  A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Barot, Ruchika V</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Detecting collusion in public procurement is critical to ensure fair and transparent practices in government acquisitions. Bid collusion in auctions poses a major challenge in public procurement by causing unfair price hikes through unlawful cooperation among competing firms, consistently affecting the overall supply chain. This study uses machine learning methods to investigate collusion in public procurement processes. It delves deeply into exploring multiple machine learning models such as random forests, extra tree classifiers, support vector classifiers, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and various combinations of models for collusion detection. First, the models were trained using available data, followed by the inclusion of screening variables derived from bid information as additional features. The additional features were fed to the models, which went through fine-tuning of parameters. Additionally, comparative analyses were carried out to evaluate the merits and drawbacks of each model. Metrics including Accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score were evaluated, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Various settings were used to compare which set of inputs gives the highest accuracy in collusion detection. The ROC-AUC analysis brought forward crucial insights, particularly regarding models' abilities to minimize false positives while maximizing true positives. Models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting demonstrated superior performance, showcasing lower false positive rates—a crucial aspect when identifying collusion in public procurement. Additionally, the study underscores the significance of feature engineering in collusion detection. Specifically, attributes like screens - CV, SPD, DIFFP, RD, SKEW, KURTO, and KS significantly aid algorithms in processing data effectively to identify collusion patterns. The outcomes of this study carry significant implications for both the specific domain under investigation and the broader field of collusion detection. Ultimately, this research provides a valuable guide for policymakers, procurement officers, and data scientists, offering valuable insights into the effective machine learning techniques tailored for detecting collusion in public procurement.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Leveraging Stack Traces for Spectrum-based Fault Localization in the Absence of Failing Tests</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Barreto Simedo Pacheco, Lorena</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Bug fixing is a crucial task in software maintenance to hold user trust. Although various automated fault localization techniques exist, they often require specific conditions to be effective. For example, Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques need at least one failing test to identify bugs, which may not always be available. Bug reports, particularly those with stack traces, provide detailed information on system execution failures and are invaluable for developers. This study focuses on utilizing stack traces from crash reports as fault-triggering tests for SBFL. Our findings indicate that only 3.33% of bugs have fault-triggering tests, limiting traditional SBFL efficiency. However, 98.3% of bugfix intentions align directly with exceptions in stack traces, and 78.3% of buggy methods are reachable within an average of 0.34 method calls, proving stack traces as a reliable source for locating bugs. We introduce a new approach, SBEST, that integrates stack trace data with test coverage to enhance fault localization. Our approach shows a significant improvement, increasing Mean Average Precision (MAP) by 32.22% and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) by 17.43% over traditional stack trace ranking methods.</etd_ms:description>

Amiodarone Effects on Phospholipidosis in NR8383 Lung Macrophages: A Multimodal Analysis Using SIMS and Fluorescence Microscopy

Matin Bastani

Abstract: Cationic amphiphilic Ddugs (CADs) constitute an intriguing group of FDA-approved pharmaceuticals that have the capability to accumulate within human cells, influencing their functions and structural integrity.1 Our research focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of the accumulation of amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug classified as a CAD, within a specific model system, NR8383 lung macrophages. To achieve this, we employed advanced techniques such as fluorescent microscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to shed light on this phenomenon. Our investigation is particularly concerned with phospholipidosis, a condition characterized by abnormal lipid build-up in cellular membranes induced by CADs.2 By characterizing the accumulation of amiodarone within individual cells, our research aims to unveil the underlying mechanisms. Two fundamental factors, drug dosage and incubation time, were central to our study. By exploring the effects of varying concentrations and exposure durations, we gained valuable insights into the dynamics of drug uptake and accumulation.
We utilized the state-of-the-art PHI nanoTOF II TOF-SIMS instrument to image individual cells, dosed and un-dosed, and compared their biochemical signatures. 
Fluorescence microscopy was used to characterize the frequency and size of lysosomes, as well as the total cell size and shape in each cell. Despite the cells being monoclonal and cultured under consistent environmental conditions, we observed a significant variation in their response to amiodarone. By understanding the factors underlying this variation within a cell population, we can gain insights into the broader context of drug-cellular interactions and identify toxicological indicators.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>White Heat: Hawai‘i’s Territorial Elites and the Reforms of the Honolulu City and County Police Department</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bastien Corbeil, Etienne</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>My thesis looks to highlight elites’ use of policing ideology in their quest for continued access to state power. The reforms of the Police Act of February 1, 1932, were introduced by Republican lawmakers to safeguard the oligarchic rule of the Big Five sugar companies in the wake of the United States’ Federal Government’s scrutiny of the territory’s system of law enforcement after the Ala Moana trial and the murder of Joseph Kahahawai. The reforms represented the culmination of more than a decade of advocacy and public inquiries by civic leaders, progressive women, and the territory’s English language press. In times of crisis, Honolulu’s elites turned to the international network of policing experts to reform the Honolulu City and County Police Department and affirmed its status as the protector of the ruling class. In the first chapter, I look at how the police proved instrumental in defining the notion “security” for haole elites who understood the growing presence of racialized people outside of the plantation and in Honolulu’s urban landscape as a threat to the sugar planter’s oligarchy’s social order. I examine three key moments in Honolulu’s history where elites agitated for an increase in police repression of racialized people: the 1920 Sugar Workers’ Strike, the Kaka‘ako case of 1923, and the 1924 Filipino Sugar Workers’ Strike. In the second chapter, I dig into the ideological and legislative origins of the Police Act of February 1, 1932. I identify August Vollmer as an imperial importer (Go, 2020) of militarized technologies whose Berkeley Police Department served as the principal reference for the reforms envisaged by Honolulu’s lawmakers. The principles of professional policing promulgated by Vollmer provided elites with the justification and the means to insulate their system of oligarchic control from the interference of the federal government and the majority Native Hawaiian and Asian population. The changes put in motion by the Hawaiian territorial legislative house in 1932 were cemented during the 14-year tenure of Honolulu’s second police chief William A. Gabrielson. Gabrielson, a former Berkeley Police Department officer, transformed the Honolulu City and County Police Department into a state-of-the-art police force proficient in the type of surveillance operations the FBI and the U.S. military would require the police department to conduct during the Second World War.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Acting Now or Later: The Role of Message Framing and Temporal Distance in Promoting Sustainable Consumer Behavior</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Batra, Prateek</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Promoting sustainable behaviors is essential in addressing the severe environmental challenges posed by human activities. Prior research on persuasive messaging has extensively explored the efficacy of gain vs. loss message framing. When it comes to environmental sustainability, gains (i.e., benefits) and losses (i.e., harms) often accrue in the future, thus temporal distance is an important dimension. The efficacy of presenting gains and losses in the present vs. future remains underexamined in the context of sustainability messaging. In particular, I discuss two theoretical perspectives that make different predictions about how message framing may interact with temporal distance to shape behavior. Across three studies, this thesis investigates how these variables influence purchase intentions for sustainable products. Study 1 found a significant interaction between framing and temporal distance—future-oriented loss messages led to higher purchase intentions than present-oriented loss messages, while temporal distance did not impact gain-framed messages. Study 2 replicated the effect for loss-framed messages, while gain-framed messages exhibited the reverse effect—purchase intentions were higher when gains were present- rather than future-oriented. These effects were marginally significant. Study 3 attempted to replicate these results, but found null effects. Overall, this thesis highlights the complex interplay between message framing and temporal distance, suggesting that the current understanding—both theoretical and empirical—of this topic remains incomplete. Lastly, theoretical contributions, practical implications, and future directions for research are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>DNA synthesis is fundamental to synthetic biology, yet existing technologies face significant constraints in terms of sequence length, cost, and efficiency. Current technologies lack the control necessary to consolidate the oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA assembly on a single platform. In my thesis I introduce a digital microfluidics platform capable of performing DNA synthesis. This technology is enabled through the combined use of magnetized controlled pore glass beads with phosphoramidite functionalization and a non-standard set of synthesis reagents compatible with digital microfluidics. This work demonstrates evidence of reagent compatibility, magnetic pore glass characterization, and provides initial evidence of oligonucleotide synthesis on a digital microfluidic device.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Turning toward the past while propelled by a desire for futurity, this thesis explores the intersections of art and memory in the artwork of American artist and writer, Eric Rhein (b. 1961). Diagnosed with HIV in 1987 at the age of twenty-seven, Rhein’s survivorship affirms the endurance of queer love as well as the perseverance required to navigate a life-changing diagnosis in both a socially and epidemiologically tumultuous terrain. The first section evaluates the importance of the past through lineages of queer representation, contributing to Rhein’s inclination toward self-documentation while additionally laying the foundational framework for activist forces that later permeated the united confrontational response to the AIDS crisis. The second chapter investigates the transformative powers of queer love enlivened through collective manifestations of mourning and activism, highlighting the significance of vulnerability, social contingency, community, and proximity. Finally, the closing chapter draws upon the speculative potentials of queer world-making, both embodied and ephemeral, emphasizing the (non)linearity of queer temporalities. Converging with the contemporary era of undetectability, this thesis critically (re)considers memories versus histories as resistive modalities present in curatorial and institutional settings, permitting the development and bridging the excluded within a utopian architecture saturated with possibility, belonging, and care. Focused centrally on the preservation and celebration of those lost to AIDS-related complications, Rhein’s body of work exists as a living archive, transcending disseminated narratives of loss, proliferating and expanding much like our ever-evolving relationship to HIV and AIDS.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The Psalter-Hours of Bonne of Luxembourg is a small illuminated manuscript and personal prayer book that was made in Paris in the mid-fourteenth century for the Duchess of Normandy’s daily private devotional practice. While the texts are mostly in Latin, the manuscript concludes with a selection of prayers that meditate on Christ’s Passion, written in vernacular French. The two final illuminated pages from this section, The Crucifixion and The Wound of Christ, form a distinctly climactic moment in the manuscript and have drawn much attention from scholars of Medieval piety. 
In this thesis, the Psalter of Bonne of Luxembourg serves as a case study to examine how political and theological developments of the early fourteenth century influenced the private devotional practice of Bonne of Luxembourg. My analysis takes into account the historical context of lay women’s use of devotional literature, Bonne’s monastic upbringing, the Valois court and theories of vision from the Patristic era that were highly influential during the late Middle Ages. This thesis argues how the portrait of Bonne and her husband, John II of France, in the Crucifixion miniature along with its accompanying prayers and marginalia provide evidence that her prayer book may have facilitated a visual devotional strategy that prepared her for the visio Dei, or the beatific vision of God, which was a subject of particular importance in Paris during Bonne’s lifetime.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Because of the current trends in buildings which favor a higher window to wall area ratio, the impact of fenestration on the indoor environment has become crucial. New technologies appearing in the market make windows an active tool in controlling visual and thermal comfort, while allowing for energy generation through renewable sources such as photovoltaics. 
The goal of this study is to present a control strategy for an integrated venetian blinds system within a triple glazed window with bifacial silicon photovoltaic cells on the outer glazing to optimize occupant visual comfort within a one-person office space. To achieve this, four objectives were considered. First, a visual transmittance model was developed to mimic the real-life behavior of the window under clear and cloudy conditions. The model was then integrated into a control strategy that uses the fenestration as an active tool for ensuring optimal visual comfort for office related activities, while reducing the energy used for heating by controlling passive solar gains. The control strategy determines the optimal blind tilt angle at each time step based on the outdoor climate conditions and occupancy schedule of the space. Next, the model and control strategy output were validated using measured data from an outdoor test-room representing an office space in Montreal, Quebec. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the impact of physical parameters of the indoor environment on the visual comfort of the occupants. The window to wall ratio, the reflectance of the surfaces, and the room geometry were analyzed through simulation. 
Using the control strategy, the results show that under clear sky conditions, the space can be self-sufficient in terms of illuminance levels but deals with certain levels of glare throughout the day. However, even though glare is imperceptible throughout the occupancy period under cloudy sky conditions, the illuminance levels do not reach the required 300 lux threshold for 23% of the day, requiring the integration of an artificial lighting source to fill in the missing gap to achieve the needed levels. In terms of physical properties of the space, it was found that an increase in the room dimensions leads to a decrease in illuminance levels, while a decrease in window to wall ratio also has the same impact. The surfaces reflectance also affects visual comfort, since highly reflective surfaces increase the work plane illuminance compared to more opaque surfaces. Overall, the control strategy presented in this work can be scalable and applicable to any type of office space that uses a similar advanced fenestration system.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This study examined the effects of beetroot powder on acute and chronic anaerobic sprint intervals (RST) and muscular endurance (MET). In a quasi-experimental design 7 male MMA athletes with 2+ years’ experience was given 13mmol/L beet powder (BRJ) mixed with 500ml of water 2-3 hours before RST and MET 72h after completing a baseline test. Following the acute test participants were given BRJ for 21-days which followed a wash out period for 21-days. Measurements during the RST taken; lactate levels, punch power, punch speed, total punches, and total kicks. Measurements during the MET were lactate levels and total reps. The results of the current study showed an increase in total workload in the acute setting for total punches p&gt;0.05 ES 0.65, kicks p = 0.07 ES 0.82, chest passes p&lt;0.05 ES 1 and squat pick-ups p&lt;0.05 ES 0.89. Lactate values during RST at the 1-minute and 3- minute mark showed a p&gt;0.05 with an ES of 0.32 and 0.26. The MET lactate values showed a p&gt;0.05 ES 0.25 at the 1-minute mark and p=0.01 ES 1.28 at the 3-minute mark. Chronic testing showed a total increase in workload for total punches p=0.008 η² = .55 and a power value of 0.86, P = 0.01, η² = .49 and a power value of 0.77. Lactate values at the one- and three-minute mark P = 0.92 and P = 0.31, η² = .13, η² = .24 with a power value of 0.17 and 0.31. The MET testing showed an P &lt; 0.001, η² = .69 and a power value of 0.98 for chest passes and P &lt; 0.001, η² = .87 and a power value of 1.0 for squat pick-ups. Lactate values at the one- and three- minute mark for chest passes showed a P = 0.45 η² = 0.12, P = 0.09, η² = .33, with a power value of 0.16 and 0.46. Medball squat pick-ups at the one- and three- minute mark showed a P&lt;0.001 η² = .71, P&lt;0.001 η² = .82 with a power value of 0.99 and 1.0. In conclusion BRJ has an acute and chronic benefit on sports performance in MMA athletes with the ability to increase total workload, decreased fatigue perception and improve muscular endurance blood lactate values with a moderate to large ES benefit.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Modularized Directed Greybox Fuzzing for Cross-Architecture Binary Analysis</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Benahmed, Sofiane</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) has proven effective in vulnerability detection, such as bug reproduction and patch testing. Despite this, existing directed fuzzers are often complex monolithic tools that lack modularity and have limited binary support. This constrains their usability on complex software or when the source code is unavailable; a complexity encountered when fuzzing embedded systems. In this thesis, we address these limitations by introducing the Directed Fuzzing Toolkit (DRIFT) as a foundational platform for directed fuzzing within the modular framework of LibAFL. DRIFT modularizes techniques from the state-of-the-art directed fuzzer AFLGo and adapts them for binary applications across CPU architectures. This design augments fuzzers built on top of LibAFL with directed fuzzing capabilities at the binary level thereby enhancing the applicability of DGF on a variety of targets and facilitating the adaptation of these techniques for IoT fuzzing. Our evaluation of DRIFT shows a 90% correlation in distance metric computation over binary over multiple architectures compared to its source-code counterpart. Fuzzing performance was also notable despite operating over emulation. In benchmarks, DRIFT’s performance exceeds the original fuzzer with doubled bug discovery rates and 9-40x faster exploitation times. This accomplishment is attributed to the advantages conferred by our toolkit’s modular design and its native integration with LibAFL. Additionally, DRIFT introduces a profiling platform for directed fuzzing metrics and seamless integration with the Magma benchmark. Together, these features position it as a practical advancement in directed fuzzing within LibAFL.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Ce mémoire de maîtrise explore l’interface entre l’histoire orale et la cartographie alternative. La pensée visuelle y est utilisée comme outil d’écoute, d’archivage, d’analyse et de diffusion d’entretiens qualitatifs. Le cas d’étude, le projet "Raconte-moi Riopelle" (2021-2023), réunit 21 récits autour de la vie et de l’œuvre de l’artiste Jean-Paul Riopelle (1923-2002). La méthodologie originale de recherche-création repose sur un inventaire graphique du corpus et des processus d’analyse cartographiques inspirés de la cartographie sensible et de la visualisation inductive. Sur le plan du contenu, la recherche met en lumière, d’une part, l’homogénéité des participant.e.s au projet, principalement liés aux sphères artistiques. D’autre part, la recherche révèle six thèmes qui traversent les récits. Les quatre premiers concernent un portrait en nuances de Riopelle, concernant sa personnalité, son sens de l’humour, ses liens amicaux, et sa relation au temps. Les deux autres thèmes s’articulent autour de la création et du regard, véritables fils conducteurs des récits. Sur le plan méthodologique, la recherche confirme l’efficacité de la pensée visuelle à traiter des matériaux d’histoire orale. D’abord, les annotations graphiques ont optimisé l’écoute et favorisé la mémorisation des récits. Ensuite, la spatialisation des données a facilité leur analyse. En complément du processus d’analyse, une série de collages photographiques exprime la complexité sensible du corpus. Ces images offrent un point d’entrée plus personnel vers le corpus. En somme, ce mémoire ouvre la voie à de nouvelles façon d’aborder le traitement et la diffusion de données en histoire orale notamment à partir de nouvelles formes cartographiques inspirées de l’écoute.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Influence of Process Parameters on Microstructural Characteristics and Mechanical Properties of Ti-6Al-4V Samples Manufactured through Electron Beam Melting Manufacturing</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bernier-Tremblay, Camille</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is a manufacturing technique that builds solid components layer by layer. In comparison to traditional manufacturing methods, metal additive manufacturing offers advantages by allowing the creation of intricate geometries while reducing the buy-to-fly ratio of components. Understanding how manufacturing parameters affect the mechanical properties of produced components is applicable to the research and development of materials used in aero-engine and biomedical applications.
The study that is the subject of this thesis examines the microstructure of Ti64 samples printed using Electron Beam Melting (EBM) with specific variations in process parameters, such as adjustments in beam current and scan speed intended to achieve varying microstructural properties. The study compares the variations in process parameters with the types of defects and overall sample porosity. Additionally, this research explores the relationship between process parameters, defect production, and the tensile and fatigue properties of the printed samples.
The results of the microstructure examination indicate that individual process parameters significantly influence print porosity for the same Volumetric Energy Density (VED). However, VED alone does not dictate alpha lath thickness or variations in tensile properties. While porosity and defect size do not notably affect tensile properties, they impact the fatigue life of the samples with larger defects leading to a shorter fatigue life. Optical microscopy analysis of print samples provides a local estimation of defect parameters for an initial assessment and prediction of global porosity in larger printed components.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Bernier, Nicolas</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Federated Learning (FL) allows a global model to be trained collaboratively by a number of clients without sharing data. This setting is often characterized by resource-constrained clients con- nected over a low-bandwidth network. Hence, algorithms designed for the setting must account for important factors such as computer and memory requirements, robustness under changing data distributions and communication. Recent works, have started demonstrating the benefits of using pretrained models over random initialization on these considerations. We cover these recent ad- vancements before introducing methods conceived along the same lines. We show that in the FL setting, fitting a classifier using the Neurest Class Means (NCM) can be done exactly. We demon- strate its efficiency and combine it with full fine-tuning to produce stronger performance. Then, we introduce an adapted zeroth-order method capable of bringing a model to convergence with a mini- mal per-round compute budget while reducing the memory burden for clients during training down to that of inference. This work presents several experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods and highlights the importance for additional work into the application pretrained models in the FL setting.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In 2022, I moved to Paris and everything in my life fell apart. Little did I know, knitting was going to become my lifeline. This is a research-creation thesis that describes my journey through a non-linear, unconventional healing process that led me to realize that there are so many benefits to being a knitter, on both the personal and educational aspects of life. The research is supported by a theoretical foundation of punk scholarship. I argue that punks share a lot with knitters in many aspects of their ethos. Most prominently, they both consider DIY as their core value. Furthermore, I believe that they both display subversive behaviors by not conforming to the established ideas of commercial beauty. The creative portion of this project is made up of 12 shawls I have knitted in the past two years. These woolly, emotionally complex landscapes of fears and self-doubt, but also of joyful reminiscence and precious memories, have provided me with an alternative way to process inner darkness by engaging with a colorful, comforting material, as well as highlight the fact that knitting has a lot of pedagogical value, in both formal and informal schooling structures. Together, the shawls form a soft, chaotic and powerful reminder that (a), healing takes many forms, (b), there are alternative ways to develop computational skills and (c), it is ok to be punk, academic and crafty all at once.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Newcomers’ Motivation Profiles: A Review and Longitudinal Investigation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Blechman, Yael</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Anchored in a comprehensive literature review of previous person-centered research focused on work motivation profiles, the present study seeks to validate a series of theoretical scenarios likely to drive employees’ motivational orientation at work. Relying on a longitudinal study of 865 Canadian employees who started their job within the last six months, we assess the relevance of these profiles among newcomers, as well as their within-sample (generalizability over time) and within-person (profile membership and transitions) stability over a time interval of six months. To assess the construct validity of these profiles, we finally assessed their associations with need supportive and need thwarting work conditions (predictors) and a series of outcomes related to employees’ work functioning (turnover intention, emotional exhaustion, job engagement, and performance). Our results revealed five distinct profiles (Weakly Motivated Value-Driven, Self-Determined Value-Driven, Weakly Motivated/Amotivated, Strongly Motivated, and Self-Determined Hedonist) which were mainly consistent with some of the proposed scenarios. We also found that participants reporting more need supportive behaviors were more likely to belong to the Strongly Motivated and Self-Determined Hedonist profiles, while those reporting more need thwarting behaviors were more likely to belong to the Weakly Motivated Value-Driven, Self-Determined Value-Driven, and Weakly Motivated/Amotivated profiles. Finally, whereas more self-determined profiles tended to report more adaptive outcomes (i.e., lower levels of emotional exhaustion and turnover intention, and higher levels of job engagement and performance), results also revealed unexpectedly high levels of emotional exhaustion and turnover intention among the Strongly Motivated profile.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Proposed Music Therapy Program Framework for Persons Living with Dementia in Long-Term Care who are Experiencing Sundowning</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Blundon, Julia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Sundowning is a relatively common phenomenon experienced by persons living with dementia that involves a worsening of symptoms (e.g., increased confusion, agitation, anxiety, aggression, etc.) that occurs regularly in the mid-late afternoon or early evening. While music therapy holds great potential to address challenges related to sundowning, a literature review revealed no consistent music therapy applications or existing program frameworks specific to this phenomenon. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to develop a group music therapy program framework for persons living with dementia in long-term care facilities who are experiencing sundowning. The first 1.5 steps of intervention research design, as conceptualized by Fraser and Galinsky (2009; 2010), were used to define the problem, analyze the literature, and propose a theory of change. All of the information gathered and organized up to this point was then used to determine the structure and processes of the proposed group music therapy program. While this program is yet to be evaluated and further refined within a research or practice context, this study may still serve as a practical guide and advocacy tool for music therapists who would like to establish a similar type of program. Limitations of the study along with other implications for practice and future research are presented.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Reimagining Canadian Journalism: A Case Study of News Startups in Montreal</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The Canadian journalism industry has been in a self-described crisis, partly of its own making, for arguably as long as it has existed. With each new technological advancement comes a new wave of self-doubt, and in the past five years, many legacy news outlets have turned to the federal government for financial help. At the same time, a new crop of digital news startups has grown. Their numbers fluctuate, but at least 270 digital-first outlets existed in Canada as of last year (LION Publishers, 2023). These outlets tend to be more independent and less nostalgic about journalistic norms and traditions, forging new approaches to information-gathering and sharing. As trust in news media has generally eroded (Reuters, 2024), many news startups have responded by focusing on hyperlocal or niche information needs, and on direct audience engagement. Some are also exploring philanthropic funding opportunities or seeking out non-profit status, effectively turning the capitalist, ad-revenue-driven newspaper model on its head. Through a series of three 30- to 50-minute podcasts, three Montreal-based case studies – La Converse, The Rover and Pivot – are examined to help answer the question: As Canadian legacy news media crumble, how will the new kids on the block respond? Judging by interviews with the founders of the three news outlets, the next generation of journalism leaders value slowing down to conduct more long-form and investigative reporting; spotlighting voices that have been traditionally marginalized in the media; and, for some, favouring radical transparency over neutral objectivity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Boucquillon, Sophie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>With the recent challenges societies have had to face, including natural disasters and wars, non-profit organizations and the aid they provide, by the means of a mixed workforce: both local and expatriates, have become even more prevalent. However, they are facing a “talent war” as they are struggling to retain and attract new employees. Mega events, including COVID-19, have shed additional light on certain elements related to one’s well-being, mainly one’s work-life balance and work-meaningfulness, making them more valuable to employees, thus important to organizations wanting to limit turnover rates. These working experiences are seemingly still lacking understanding across the non-profit industry due to scarce research on the topic. This micro-levelled qualitative study will further explore the working experiences of non-profit employees, locals and expatriates, across a variety of non-profit organizations. 21 participants were recruited across 5 countries and their interviews were thematically analysed. Findings show that non-profit employees have an overall good sense of work meaningfulness. Work-life balance was found satisfactory by interviewees’ self-perceptions but was objectively more conflicting. Expatriates were found to have an overwhelming greater sense of work-meaningfulness compared to locally employed workforce which was seemingly associated with greater work-family conflicts. This research contributes not only to the current non-profit literature but also to practitioners, by bringing additional insights into the working experiences held across the non-profit industry as well as those that employees enjoy experiencing. Future research should focus on further establishing quantitatively this research’s findings.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Bourgeois, Zackari</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Reddit, Memes, Theological reflection, Neo-Tribes, Christianity, Online Christianity, Online communities</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates collective identity in spaces dedicated to Christianity, utilizing the subreddit` r/DankChristianMemes as a case study. Drawing from the postmodern sociological theory of neo-tribalism, with specific emphasis added to its usage in qualitative studies of offline Christian micro-groups, this thesis explores how r/DankChristianMemes demonstrates a particular form of Christian neo-tribalization on the Internet. It does so by using multimodal theolinguistic analysis and a functional approach to language, thereby using three categories of the functionality of religious language (the axiomatic, social cohesive, and emotive) to establish empirical evidence for what constitutes the group’s puissance1 and sociality – both Maffesoli-an terms denoting the group’s raison d’être and methods of establishing a process of identifying one’s self with the group. The findings reveal that from the sociological perspective, r/DankChristianMemes creates an inclusive environment for fellowship among varying groups of Christians and non-Christians, centered upon humor using Christian language, images, and references. The group also creates grounds for collective identity by mocking and critiquing certain forms of Christianity, both denominational and cultural. From a theological perspective, this thesis concludes that r/DankChristianMemes demonstrates itself to be what Maffesoli terms an “interstitial utopia,” where Christians may gather to practice the Christian ethic of permeability  (the crossing of boundaries), as well as a specific process of theological belonging that Lucien Richard terms “the dialogical process.”</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>ABSTRACT
Managing E-Learning Projects for Workplace Learning: An Integrative Review of the Peer Reviewed and Professional Literature
Tetiana Brandt 
Research Problem: Workplace learning organizations face challenges in managing e-learning projects effectively as they strive to adapt to the digital age and meet modern learners’ needs. This study aims to explore theses management practices, focusing on how organizations handle e-learning projects and the factors that influence their approaches. 
Research Question: How do workplace learning organizations manage e-learning projects?
Literature Review: The literature review focuses on two essential bodies of literature that are fundamental to the management of e-learning projects: instructional design models and project management theory. Together, these perspectives offer a comprehensive foundation for understanding how e-learning projects are managed in workplace settings. 
Method: The study employs an integrative literature review methodology, with sources selected through replicable search parameters. The final dataset includes 57 sources published between 20023 and 2023. Content analysis was then applied to examine publications, a method well-suited for uncovering patterns and themes within the literature. 
Results and Conclusions: The study reveals key insights into managing e-learning projects in workplace learning organizations, offering implications for practice, research and theory. Practitioners should understand the distinct roles of instructional design models and projects management methodologies, and how to integrate both effectively. Theoretical contributions highlight the need for hybrid frameworks addressing project complexity and emerging technology. Limitations include reliance of English-language sources and a focus on specific industries. Future research should explore diverse contexts, validate findings empirically, and assess the impact of AI and new technologies on e-learning project management.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Brisson, Kyleigh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>As music therapy services continue to become more accessible, music therapists are working with a wider range of clientele with specific needs. Adolescents experiencing eating disorders (AEED) are among those with whom music therapists work to provide support throughout the treatment process. The purpose of this philosophical inquiry was to synthesize existing knowledge and evidence to substantiate the argument that music therapy (as realized within three categories of experience) is an ideal way to support the development of healthy coping skills for adolescents experiencing eating disorders. The methodology involved clarifying the research terms, exposing and evaluating underlying assumptions, relating ideas as systematic theory, and using argument as a primary mode of inquiry. The findings discussed how adolescents engage with music, current approaches in music therapy for the targeted clientele, and considerations for music therapists working with AEED. The findings confirm that music therapy can be a valuable resource for AEED, providing a space to reflect on coping patterns through composition, improvisation, and receptive music therapy experiences.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Reinforcing Safety or Perpetuating Harm? Examining The Role and Effectiveness of Bill 151 and Sexual
Violence Prevention Efforts in Montreal Universities</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Brookes Gilligan, Ciara</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines the effectiveness of Bill 151 and sexual violence prevention efforts
within Montreal universities. Bill 151, enacted by the Quebec government in 2017, mandates
higher education institutions to implement policies, training, and reporting mechanisms to
combat sexual violence. Through secondary data analysis, this research evaluates annual reports
and prevention policies from seven Montreal universities, assessing their adherence to Bill 151
and their impact on reducing sexual violence. The study reveals inconsistencies in policy
implementation, reporting quality, and prevention efforts among institutions. While some
universities demonstrate transparency and thoroughness, others exhibit gaps in data collection,
accountability, and survivor support. Findings indicate that institutional bias, lack of
standardized reporting, and low participation in training programs hinder the effectiveness of
these measures. Moreover, the persistence of underreporting and cultural barriers reflects
systemic issues within academic environments. By analyzing trends in reported cases and
prevention initiatives, the thesis underscores the need for intersectional, survivor-centered
approaches that address the root causes of sexual violence and institutional shortcomings.
Recommendations include enhancing training programs, improving data transparency, and
fostering a cultural shift to combat rape culture and promote accountability. This research
contributes to understanding how universities can better ensure campus safety and equity for all
students.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The overarching motivation of After and Before centers on a deeply ingrained desire for a candid, authentic and occasionally humorous portrayal of queer identities—particularly within a Canadian context—and to explore themes and subjects that are, in the opinion of the writer, not readily addressed within the sphere of contemporary queer literature. These subjects include domestic and sexual violence, the construction of body image, the experience of aging as a queer individual, loneliness and grief, and the influence of heteronormative values within the LGBTQ+ community. The cross-generational approach to this collection seeks to highlight the abiding systemic prejudices aimed against queer individuals within a variety of narrative styles. Thus, an interconnected thematic arc exists between all the stories featured within this anthology. From the 1980s of “Salmon Son” to the bleak near-future of “Rhetoric,” After and Before highlights the all too frequently circular nature of oppression and otherization within our society.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>When the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of live concerts, thousands of industry workers across North America, including myself, were left unemployed. This research-creation project investigates the structural problems exposed by the pandemic and presents the personal histories of eight industry workers to better understand (and critique) pre-existing precarious labour conditions within the North American live music industry. Interviews were conducted with both musicians and behind-the-scenes workers, namely a sound technician, a tour manager, a promoter, a booking agent, a venue owner, and a music non-profit organization worker. These interviews were then assembled into podcast episodes. The podcast form was selected to create a dialogue between researcher and participant, while making the information easily accessible to non-academic audiences. Using Brooke Erin Duffy's concept of "aspirational labour" (2015) and the idea of creative precarity developed by Hesmondhalgh (2018), Ross (2008), and Curtin &amp; Sanson (2016), this thesis demonstrates that the return of concerts post-pandemic uncovered significant flaws in the music industry. Workers are primarily self-employed and cannot access traditional workplace benefits such as weekly salaries, healthcare plans or retirement funds. They also work long hours in precarious conditions in the hopes of obtaining more lucrative opportunities. Yet, the pandemic-induced pause on live events has prompted many workers to reconsider fair treatment, leading to organized efforts to challenge these conditions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Examining Dietary Clusters in Candidates for Metabolic-Bariatric Surgery and their Association to Metabolic Status</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Candidates for metabolic-bariatric surgery (MBS) have a unique nutritional status profile; clustering their macronutrients and micronutrients dietary intakes may present inter-individual differences. This study aimed to: (1) describe the macro- and micro- nutrient intake patterns in candidates for a MBS; and (2) assess the associations between these patterns and metabolic status (body fat %, HbA1c, lipid profile, granulocytes (GR), international normalised ratio, C- Reactive Proteins). Three-day dietary data from a mobile application and metabolic markers from a blood draw were collected 3 months pre-MBS from a study conducted in Quebec, Canada. Participants’ (N=30) mean age was 45.50 ± 9.83 years and BMI was 46.03 ± 7.61 kg/m2. Using the FASTCLUS procedure, a high sugar/high caloric diet (Cluster 1), high protein/high cholesterol diet (Cluster 2), and a low fiber/low saturated fat diet (Cluster 3) were observed. Analyses demonstrated significantly greater low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (5.28 ± 0.71 mmol/L) and GR (5.64 ± 0.21 109/L) in Cluster 1 relative to Clusters 2 (LDL: 2.38 ± 0.28 mmol/L; p= 0.0130), (GR: 4.71 ± 0.09 109/L; p= 0.003) and 3 (LDL: 1.76 ± 0.44 mmol/L; p = 0.0097), (GR: 5.01 ± 0.15 109/L; p= 0.015). Findings can inform variability in nutrient distribution in candidates for MBS. Future studies should compare these clusters to a control group or post-surgery dietary clusters and metabolic status.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Burdman-Castravelli, Emily</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study examined the impact of the work-nonwork interface on job search behaviour. Specifically, I investigated the effects of work-nonwork conflict and enrichment on job search intensity, job search quality, and haphazard job search, as well their indirect effects on these variables via downward and upward adjustment of job search goals. I also explored the role of three career motives, authenticity, balance, and challenge, as moderators of the relations between conflict and enrichment, and goal adjustment. Survey data were collected from 308 participants who were employed and actively looking for a new job. A correlational, sequential, time-lagged design was used, with three surveys distributed at one-week intervals. I found that conflict is positively related to haphazard job search, which is low quality job searching, whereas enrichment is positively related to job search quality, which is high quality job searching. In addition, I found that upward goal adjustment serves as a linking mechanism between enrichment and both job search intensity and quality. No support was found for the proposed moderation hypotheses, although some direct effects of career motives on job search goal adjustment were found. This research provides job seekers with insight into how their experiences with conflict and enrichment can shape their goal adjustment patterns and job search behaviours. Findings offer practical guidance on how people can adapt their behaviour to foster achievement of their goals and choose strategies to enhance the quality of their job search.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring Granular Scaling Laws via Parabolic Flight Experiments to Advance Lunar Rover Mobility Predictions</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Butt, George</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Rovers, Mobility, Traction, Lunar, Moon, Soils, Parabolic flights, Testing, Wheel-soil interaction</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>It remains a significant challenge to accurately predict the performance of wheels driven on loose granular terrains in low gravity. Planetary rover testing predominantly consists of reduced-weight testing, the use of specially designed soil simulants, or a combination of both; however, these methods overlook how gravity affects the soil during the wheel-soil interaction. 

An emerging prediction method is Granular Scaling Laws (GSL), allowing the prediction of wheel mobility metrics (traction, sinkage, and power consumption) across two different gravity levels with sets of nondimensional parameters. However, a recently proposed cohesion term would constrain the wheel radius ratio to the inverse ratio of the gravity levels, indicating that a scaled test wheel on Earth in 1-g should have a radius 1/6 that of a full-scale wheel on the Moon in 1/6-g since Lunar regolith has non-zero cohesion. Furthermore, it is possible for cohesion to become a major component of the soil strength in low gravity. To investigate the cohesion term, this research conducted wheel slip experiments in high fidelity cohesive LMS-1 Lunar regolith simulant during a Lunar gravity parabolic flight campaign in 2023. Comparing the results of this campaign with those from the research group’s earlier 2020 campaign that used noncohesive soil, there is compelling evidence that the cohesion constraint can be ignored for soils with cohesion and bulk density values comparable to real regolith on the Lunar surface. Additionally, refined frictional corrections show that GSL overestimates the traction force, contrary to the result from the previous campaign.

These findings are fundamental to future rover testing and mission planning. Impractical 1/6-scale test units are likely not required for Lunar rovers, and all mobility metrics using GSL should be carefully interpreted despite it being the best physical prediction method currently available.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>A long-standing relationship between the map and visual art is continued today by a number of contemporary artists whose work uses a variety of cartographic concepts and strategies. This thesis focuses on three artists, Sandy Rodriguez, Firelei Báez, and Shuvinai Ashoona, who address and undermine the map as a technology of colonial power. Brought together for the first time here, these three artists accomplish a decolonial subversion of the map–as an object complicit in past and present processes of colonization. Drawing on the work of scholars from geography, Black studies, decolonial studies, and art history, this thesis addresses, in detail, how each artist’s work pushes back against the assumed authority of the map.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Byrne, Isabella</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Initiated during COVID, this research utilizes material autoethnographic methods to study the video games Gris, Journey, and Season: Letter to the Future. This thesis contributes to 1) the debates in pilgrimage and cyberpilgrimage around the validity of a pilgrimage not physically taken, 2) the potential of a relationship between games and pilgrimage and what that reveals about both mediums, and 3) offering tools to game designers looking to replicate the emotional experiences felt in each of the games played, asking: what do video games as a medium afford pilgrimage, what does pilgrimage offer journeying games, and what can we learn about digital journeying through their comparison? Is playing a video game the same as doing a terrestrial pilgrimage?

This work concludes that playing a video game is not the same as doing a terrestrial pilgrimage, but that it has specific affordances and constraints which make it affective due to the way it attends to the body, senses, material, locality, and everyday. It is a counter-argument to the idea that both play and cyberpilgrimage are disembodied. Games afford a unique kind of experience and transformation for undertaking pilgrimage, and pilgrimages afford a unique kind of play. As such, to ask at what pilgrimage and games can afford each other is not to assert dominance (or homogeneity) between terrestrial and cyber- pilgrimage, but rather to ask at large: What are the varieties of meaning derived from different forms of pilgrimage and what brings them about?</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Development and Analysis of Various CO2 Capture and Utilization Pathways for DME Production</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Cabarcas Toro, Angelica Maria</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Sustainable energy resources are required to address the rising demand for energy while promoting economic stability. Dimethyl ether (DME) is a second-generation environmentally friendly fuel that offers an alternative for replacing traditional petroleum fuels. In this project, we designed three distinctive pathways for the synthesis of DME from syngas. A comprehensive analysis was also conducted, including the production and thermal efficiency, economic, and environmental impact perspectives, to evaluate the outcomes of each pathway. For each section, a rigorous process simulation was conducted using Aspen Plus and considering detailed catalytic reaction modelling.
According to our results, the production rate of the Direct Method, yielding 1.21 kg DME/kg CO2, demonstrated an improvement to 1.37 kg DME/kg CO2 with the integration of the Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) process. Notably, the Indirect Model emerged as the most favorable, exhibiting a superior outcome with a DME yield of 1.95 kg DME/kg CO2.
Conducting a Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) unveiled that the Indirect Method stands as the most economically advantageous, attributed to its lowest Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of 2465 $/tonne and the highest annual revenue of 437 $Million.
Upon assessing the environmental impacts of the pathways through the TRACI 2.1 methodology, it was revealed that the Indirect Method requires the lowest amount of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) avoided credits, valued at 0.164 $/kgCO2, due to the proximity of the MSP and the Market Price (MP).
The combination of superior yield and economic viability outcomes, positions the Indirect Method as the most competitively advantageous approach in this research.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Children’s early writing skills at preschool may mediate their future academic success. However, preschool activities solely support transcription despite being only one-half of the writing equation. Introducing a writing purpose can support composition, and one rooted in children’s personal experiences may facilitate their engagement in meaningful writing. The present study used a picture of preschoolers' sociodramatic play experience as a contextual writing prompt to examine whether children’s writing abilities and engagement in a writing process change depending on the context of the picture prompt. A sample of 18 preschoolers participated in a recorded sociodramatic play session, followed by a process-oriented writing session. In a fully within-subject design, preschoolers were asked to plan, write, and read from their text using three contextual prompts. Each prompt included a speech bubble and a different picture context (i.e., preschoolers’ play session, other children's play, and a non-play picture). Children’s text productions were coded for written text sophistication and oral text productivity. Children’s time spent planning and writing were measures of their engagement in the writing process. Comparative analyses of repeated measures ANOVA showed that children's engagement in planning when prompted by the context of their sociodramatic play experience was significantly longer than the other picture prompts. The children also produced more oral text words and more advanced written forms. These findings support the development of writing tasks rooted in children’s experiences to prompt early composition and transcription as integrated skills.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effects of Quiet Quitting in a Stochastic Dynamic Model</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Campbell-Johnson, Rachel</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>A fundamental tradeoff in economics is allocating time between work and leisure. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted conventional work patterns, prompting individuals to reconsider how they had previously allocated their time. A modest but growing body of literature has identified a structural shift in the labour market, termed “quiet quitting.” The term quiet quitting refers to disengaging from one’s job and completing only the minimum required work, driven by a desire for greater work-life balance. Since 2020, this phenomenon has emerged as a key topic in research, with studies focusing on its impact and the urgent need for employers to address it. This structural shift has been particularly evident along the intensive margin, as individuals engaged with quiet quitting do not exit the labour force. Despite the growing body of literature, there is a lack of research quantifying quiet quitting and measuring its impact on the economy, particularly using dynamic stochastic models. This paper explores the impact of quiet quitting on the economy using the Hansen (1985) real business cycle model with indivisible labour. I identify two key parameters of the model that influence both aggregate and individual-level hours and conduct a series of experiments by introducing exogenous shifts into these parameters. The model effectively captures key features of quiet quitting and its impact on key economic variables, including output, consumption, capital and investment. The results show that when quantifying quiet quitting by the drop in hours between 2019 and 2022, output, consumption, investment and the capital stock decrease by 3.0-4.3 percent. The findings also demonstrate that with quiet quitting, output, investment, hours and the capital stock become less volatile.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>To Taste a Portal: Contending with Cuban Colonial-era Histories through María Magdalena Campos-Pons’ Alchemy of the Soul, Elixir for the Spirits</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines María Magdalena Campos-Pons’ multisensory exhibition Alchemy of the Soul, Elixir for the Spirits (2015) as a means of resuscitating and preserving immaterial histories belonging to enslaved and indentured plantation labourers. The exhibition features immersive blown-glass installations, experimental soundscapes, an opportunity to taste freshly cut sugarcane and the faint yet persistent smell of rum wafting through the exhibition space. This thesis argues for the significance of the multisensory elements cultivating a space to contend with Cuban gastropoetics. I argue that access points to these immaterial archives are palpable and simultaneously protected through these multisensory elements. The multisensory details offer a possibility to experience the constellation of histories belonging to indentured and enslaved workers unified through Cuban sugarcane production. Alchemy of the Soul, Elixir for the Spirits does not scrutinize histories concerning plantation labourers—instead, Campos-Pons renders these histories opaque by privileging and questioning the role of the alimentary
tract and encourages the revitalization of cogent immaterial archives. Building from theoretical foundations laid by Jenny Sharpe, Édouard Glissant, Tao Leigh Goffe, Fernando Ortiz, Okwui Enwezor, and Parama Roy, this thesis advocates for the importance of Campos-Pons’ multisensory exhibition in the resuscitation and preservation of colonial-era histories degraded to immaterial status.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Synthesis of Tb-UiO-66 and Eu-UiO-66 Analogues with Enhanced Photoluminescence</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Canales Gálvez, Ximena Andrea</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Over the past few decades, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have gathered considerable attention due to their potential for high surface area, crystallinity, and tunable chemical composition. These porous materials are made of metal nodes bridged by organic linkers. Due to the versatility of MOFs, they can be used for different applications ranging from wastewater remediation to biomedical imaging, amongst others. 
Rare-earth (RE) elements have unique luminescent properties, including narrow emission peaks, large Stokes’ shifts, and long luminescent lifetimes. RE-MOFs have similar properties as MOFs made from the d-block metals such as high surface areas and the capability of forming tunable pores in addition to having metal-based photoluminescence. 
This work explores a new series of Tb-based and Eu-based MOFs that were synthesised to study the effect of linker-to-metal energy transfer on the quantum yield of Tb(III) and Eu(III) emission from the MOFs. The MOFs presented in this work are analogues of Tb-UiO-66 and Eu-UiO-66 (UiO: University of Oslo). The synthesis, characterization, and photoluminescent properties of Tb-UiO-66 and Eu-UiO-66 analogues are presented in Chapter 2 and 3, respectively. The structure and properties of the materials presented are studied using powder X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy including quantum yield.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Life-threatening food allergies affect individuals on various levels, from their quality of life and mental health to the threat they impose on their safety. There is a gap in existing research that examines how music therapy might help individuals address food allergy related anxiety. As someone who has lived with a life-threatening peanut allergy my entire life, I have experienced the many complications and challenges that one faces when it comes to navigating their way through the world. The purpose of this self-heuristic inquiry was to use songwriting as a means to explore my food allergy-related anxiety. I generated data by composing a total of four original songs, each of which explored a specific topic using a writing prompt, regarding my experience of living with a food allergy. Data analysis produced three main categories that provide insight into broad perspectives on my experience, or what I call, the big picture, experiences of the additional labour that living with an allergy requires, and the varied emotions that I experience in diverse contexts. I conclude with a creative synthesis; an original song that synthesizes insights derived from the research process. Finally, this paper concludes with implications for my music therapy practice which include insights about how I can utilize the tools that I have gained throughout this process to support individuals through music therapy who live with life-threatening food allergies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Reimagining In/Visibility, Archival Practice and the Emergence of AI Cinema: An Exploration through Refik Anadol’s Artworks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Cavdar, Damla</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the characteristics of “AI Cinema” through an analysis of Refik Anadol’s works. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in moving image art challenges the existing film theory and aesthetics and redefines the conventional boundaries of archival use in visual art. Drawing from an interdisciplinary approach, this study analyzes two installations, “Data Tunnel” and “Machine Memoirs v.2” from Anadol’s Machine Memoirs: Space exhibition, to illustrate the transformative role of AI in reimagining cinematic aesthetics and expression. The first chapter concentrates on the artwork “Data Tunnel,” delves into how AI facilitates new ways of seeing and challenges traditional concepts of visibility and invisibility in art. The second chapter extends analysis from “Data Tunnel” to “Machine Memoirs v.2” and focuses on the reconstitution of archives, highlighting AI’s role in redefining archival content from mere narrative support to foundational material for artistic creation. The concluding segment synthesizes the insights from the earlier chapters to articulate the emergence of AI cinema as a new cinematic form. It identifies the departure from traditional cinematic storytelling and aesthetics, fostering a dynamic, algorithm-driven cinematic experience. Through this exploration, the thesis aims to contribute to the broader understanding of cinema’s evolution in the digital age, particularly focusing on the role of AI in forging new forms of narrative and aesthetic expression. By focusing on AI cinema, the study adds to the limited but growing academic discourse in this area, providing a clear analysis of its unique characteristics and importance in the modern cinematic landscape.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Chaaben, Mohamed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Crowd monitoring is essential for smart city applications, particularly for optimizing public transit systems. To address this need, we propose a privacy-conscious crowd-counting pipeline using Wi-Fi probe requests. This pipeline is designed to adapt to the challenges posed by the randomization of Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, which serve as unique identifiers for devices on a network. Our approach leverages a random forest-based feature selection process to identify key Information Elements and frame attributes then applies DBSCAN clustering with adaptive parameter optimization for device counting. A diffusion model generates synthetic tabular data to mitigate the limited availability of labelled data, enhancing model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy in device counting, achieving a V-measure of 0.952, an average silhouette score of 0.789, and reliable clustering counts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Chamlian, Badrouyk</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Effective fishery management relies on knowing the contributions of genetically distinct populations to mixed-stock harvests. We investigated population genomic structure and harvest contributions of lake-migratory brook trout inhabiting three large Quebec lakes (Mistassini, Mistasiniishish, Waconichi). These brook trout support fisheries important to the Cree Nation of Mistissini and their tourism outfitting industry. Together with local partners we collected 1063 samples from spawning sites and feeding areas between 2020-2022. We then used a GTseq (Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing) panel of 393 single nucleotide polymorphisms to: i) infer population genetic structure and test for unknown populations; ii) assign individuals to their population of origin, and iii) determine harvest contributions of genetically distinct populations. Our results revealed population structure in two of three study lakes and extensive movements of brook trout, with some individuals travelling over 100km away from spawning rivers. In the largest lake (Mistassini), two of three populations contributed over 90% of the lake’s harvest and exhibited distinct spatial distributions that were stable across years. In Mistasiniishish Lake, over 80% of harvested trout originated from a single, previously known population; the remaining trout originated from a cryptic, unsampled population with a strongly overlapping spatial distribution. No population structure was detected in Waconichi Lake. We also detected low levels of migration from Mistasiniishish Lake into Mistassini Lake through a waterfall historically reported to be a dispersal barrier. Our results illustrate the precision afforded by GTseq to inform insights into the ecology and genetics of lake-migratory salmonids, thereby facilitating local management for sustainable fisheries.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the auditory experience of cyclists, delving into perceptions and interactions with sound that are unique to that mode of transportation. I drew upon autoethnographic research methods to investigate the intricate relationship between the processes of cycling and listening. Borrowing from Dylan Robinson’s concept of listening positionality, I expanded upon that concept to explore the possibility of a temporal-based, cyclist ear. Central to this exploration is the conceptual framework that the cyclist ear categorizes sounds into three distinct Levels: Level one known as self-produced sounds, Level two known as safety sounds, and Level three sounds known as ambient sounds. Self-produced sounds encompass any sounds created by the cyclist. Safety sounds refer to auditory cues signaling potential hazards. Ambient sounds denote sonic landmarks or soundmarks that aid in giving the cyclist a sense of place. To explore this theory in more depth, I utilized autoethnographic research approaches, including sound recordings and written notes, to attune to these three different Levels. Through this process, I determined that listening is indeed impacted by the act of cycling. The cycling ear does exist and does sort sound into different categories, including utility. However, the lines between the different categories can be blurred as a single sound can serve multiple purposes at once. Ultimately, this research advocates for the integration of auditory considerations into urban planning and transportation infrastructure, recognizing the significance of sound in shaping the cycling experience.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Generalization of Urban Wind Field Using Fourier Neural Operators Across Different Wind Directions and Cities</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Chen, Cheng</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In urban environments, the most common forms of air transportation are helicopters and
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). There is a high demand for air transport of small and medium
sized aircraft, including UAVs. Wind field simulations in urban environments are typically
performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and most of these models fall into the
categories of direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES). Although
these models are accurate, they are time-consuming, so there is a need to develop a more
convenient method to replace the traditional CFD methods. In recent years, with the rapid
development of artificial intelligence technology and graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, a
promising research direction has emerged. Currently, many studies are using artificial
intelligence-based deep learning techniques to transform the computational processes associated
with wind field simulation. The goal of these studies is not only to achieve the accuracy of
traditional CFD models, but to surpass them while significantly accelerating the computational
process. In this paper, we apply the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) method based on deep
learning technology to simulate the wind field in a two-dimensional urban environment. The
method uses a Fourier module to extract and learn features in the Fourier frequency domain of
the input data. Compared to traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) modules, Fourier
modules aim to learn global features in the Fourier frequency domain of the input data. In
contrast, a convolutional neural network (CNN) module performs feature learning in the local
spatial domain of the input features. In addition, the input features are processed by a Multi-
Layer Perceptron (MLP) module, and the feature output of the MLP module is added to the
feature output of the Fourier module. This structure is based on a residual network (ResNet),
which can mitigate the phenomenon of gradient vanishing or gradient explosion that occurs
when input data propagates through a multilayer network.
The FNO model ultimately maps the input features (i.e., the input wind field) to the desired
output features (i.e., the output wind field dimensions). Gradients are updated through back
propagation to reduce the discrepancy between the FNO model’s output wind field and the actual
wind field, thus facilitating the deep learning process. After a series of experiments, the optimal
settings for the Fourier layer number and the intermediate feature dimensions of the MLP in the
FNO model were determined. In this context, “intermediate feature dimensions” refers to the
number of features extracted by the MLP module. These settings ensure that the FNO model
achieves the best results on the dataset while minimizing computational overhead and resource
consumption. The training phase utilized wind field data from Niigata with westerly winds, with
a time step of 0.1 seconds, and the output consisted of wind fields at the same location with a
time step of 1 second (i.e. 10 time steps). Experimental results demonstrated that the FNO model
could predict the wind field over the entire Niigata urban area for the next 7 seconds (i.e. 70 time
i
steps), with an average absolute error of less than 0.5 m/s. Importantly, the FNO exhibited strong
generalization capabilities in different wind conditions: although the training data consisted of
westerly wind data from Niigata, the model performed well in tests with northerly winds. Further
validation across different urban geometries revealed that the FNO model could accurately
predict 70 time steps (7 seconds) of wind fields in the vertically flipped version of Niigata,
indicating that it generalizes well when the geometry is similar to the training data. However, in
Montreal, which has a significantly different urban geometry, the model’s accuracy diminished
after 10 time steps. This highlights the significance of urban geometry in wind field prediction.
During this process, the FNO’s wind field simulation was 300 times faster than that of the
CityFFD model we employed, with CityFFD requiring 2.2 seconds per step, whereas FNO took
only 0.006 seconds. This further underscores the potential of the FNO model for practical
applications in wind field simulation.
Although it is premature to use FNO directly to replace wind field simulation due to the
exponential growth of errors with time, it is possible to use it in conjunction with CityFFD and
other technologies as a complementary model. For example, the wind field output by CityFFD at
a given time step can be used as input to FNO, which can generate the wind field in the same
area at subsequent time steps. The final output wind field can be used as input to CityFFD, thus
reducing the intermediate computation time of CityFFD.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, we address the critical issue of drug shortages that has persisted during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. We develop a two-stage stochastic model aimed at understanding how a compounding pharmaceutical company can balance supplier selection, drug production, back orders, and inventory management when faced with uncertain demand.
To explore and resolve the application of two models under varying conditions, we introduce the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) and Lagrangean Decomposition methods. Additionally, to better simulate the uncertainties present in real-world scenarios, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to generate diverse cases, enabling the model to produce more reliable results.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Natural photosynthesis has inspired the development of direct and indirect approaches for solar energy conversion into chemical bonds. The use of chemical bonds to store solar energy is a promising approach to address the intermittency of the sun by harnessing sunlight to drive chemical transformations. One strategy to drive these processes is to use a bespoke semiconductor surface implemented in a photoelectrode to absorb light and generate charge carriers that can drive redox reactions such as the direct oxidation of adsorbed species on the photoanode. Dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PECs), devices inspired by photosynthesis, are being developed to advance the goal of using the sun as the sole source of energy for converting abundant resources to fuel and valuable chemicals. Furthermore, electrocatalysis shows great promise to achieve the goal of transitioning from the production of energy using fossil fuels to clean and renewable energy sources. 
Herein, this thesis describes using compact and vertically aligned titanium dioxide nanotubes as semiconducting materials for applications in both photoelectrochemistry and electrocatalysis. Functionalizing with a molecular copper(I) bis(diimine)-based donor-chromophore-acceptor assembly yields a photoanode capable of carrying out oxidative processes. Surface characterization and photoelectrochemical studies point to the nanotubes being intrinsically sensitized with carbon impurities such as carbon nitrides for visible light absorption. The ability of unfunctionalized and dye-sensitized photoanodes to drive oxidative processes is further confirmed photoelectrochemically and in the presence of a water oxidation catalyst where a Faradaic efficiency of 84% is found for O2 production. Titanium dioxide nanotubes with distinct morphologies arising from different electrolyte compositions used in the synthesis process are decorated with photoelectrochemically deposited CoOx and used as an electrocatalyst for hydrazine oxidation and as an electrochemical transducer for hydrazine sensing. Although a substantial amount of work remains to be done to assess the anode-supported electrocatalyst against other existing systems, the device shows promise for sensing hydrazine.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Energy disaggregation, or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), is a technique that predicts the consumption levels of individual appliances from only the main signal in the building. Various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, including sparse coding (SC), which offers great advantages due to its ability to capture complex patterns in data. However, a challenging aspect of NILM is that data containing appliance-level information is scarce.  Moreover, the houses that the models are tested on might be from a different population than the training data, thus resulting in a domain shift. Therefore, we need to develop approaches that are adapted to training data scarcity through the use of transfer learning (TL), also known as domain adaptation. In this research work, we explore domain adaptation approaches on SC models with the aim of discriminative energy disaggregation (DD). We compare 4 methods that employ TL, two of which are deep architectures, with 4 methods that do not employ it. In the second part of this thesis, we explore constraining NILM domain adaptation to a privacy-preserving Federated Learning framework. In this case, the NILM models are being trained in a framework that does not allow data to be shown to any model outside of the building's domain. This allows us to experiment with distributed methods in a more realistic setting, where user data is omitted from any third party. For this task, we propose 4 weighted federated domain adaptation methods. We also experiment with weighting methods that further protect the privacy of the user, resulting in a total of 12 approaches that we compared.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Confirmation of Genes Involved in the Degradation of Protocatechuate in Aspergillus niger through Characterization of their Encoded Enzymes</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Chow, Nicholas</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and renewable source of aromatic compounds and carbohydrates. Microbial lignin catabolism leads to the formation of seven central aromatic intermediates that have potential markets valuated in the billions. Protocatechuate is one of the most common central intermediates and is the precursor to chemical building blocks, including cis,cis-muconic acid, used for production of bioplastics, cosmetics, food preservatives and antioxidants. Understanding the full extent of the microbial aromatic catabolic pathways is necessary to design the most efficient strains to produce valuable chemicals from protocatechuate. Aromatic catabolic pathways have been mapped out in bacteria, however, the equivalent pathways in fungi have not been as well characterized. In this study, the candidate genes NRRL3_01405, NRRL3_02586 and NRRL3_01409 encoding protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase, 3-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate cyclase and β-carboxymuconolactone hydrolase/decarboxylase in the Aspergillus niger protocatechuate catabolic pathway were expressed in Escherichia coli. The target proteins were purified by column chromatography and characterized by enzyme activity assays.
The products of each enzyme were characterized by time-of-flight mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. NRRL3_00837 was determined to not participate in the in vitro catabolism of protocatechuate to β-ketoadipate despite having been previously reported to participate in the in vivo protocatechuate catabolism. Mapping out the central aromatic catabolic pathways in fungi may lead to the refinement of strains engineered for lignin valorization and bioremediation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Non-performing loans (NPL) and foreign direct investment (FDI) are pivotal financial parameters exerting contrasting effects on economic performance, particularly in developing and emerging economies. Foreign direct investment, known for stimulating economic activity, has the potential to reduce the number of non-performing loans. This paper investigates how foreign direct investment influences non-performing loan dynamics using data from Bangladesh spanning from 1991 to 2022 alongside key macroeconomic variables. The findings indicate that, overall, FDI has a very minimal positive impact on NPL, underscoring that the relationship between foreign investment and banking stability is complex and likely influenced by multiple factors beyond just FDI.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the impact of childcare availability on women’s labor market outcomes in low-income areas of Dhaka, using data from the Dhaka Low-Income Area Gender, Inclusion, and Poverty Survey 2018. A multinomial logistic regression model is used to study how socio-economic and demographic factors affect labor market outcomes. Findings show that higher education and childcare access increase the likelihood of full-time employment, while cultural conservativeness and lack of childcare access heighten the probability of being out of the labor force. Residing in slum areas negatively affects full-time employment prospects. Part-time employment is identified as a viable option for young mothers. The study highlights the importance of accessible childcare and education in enhancing women’s workforce participation in Dhaka’s low-income areas.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The aim of this thesis is to classify truncated Barsotti-Tate groups over p-torsion free quasi-syntomic rings via a semilinear category which is a prismatic analogue of the category truncated displays introduced by Lau-Zink. This rests crucially on the classification of p-divisible groups over quasi-syntomic rings due to Anschutz-Le Bras and an argument of Beilinson which was used by Kisin to deduce a similar classification of truncated Barsotti-Tate groups over rings of integers of p-adic fields in terms of certain Breuil-Kisin modules.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Shifting To Renewable Furan Candidates: Synthesis and Study of New Optoelectronic Materials</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Cigana, Brandon</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>With climate concerns consistently growing, the chemical industry must shift away from petrochemicals and turn to sustainable feedstocks derived from lignocellulosic biomass. There is urgency to develop new synthetic methodologies that effectively convert biomass-derived starting materials into useful consumer products. The production of multi-arylated furans and 2,5-furan-based oligomers, has gained popularity as organic candidates for light-emitting diodes or field-effect transistors, owing to their favourable optoelectronic properties found in highly conjugated furan-based materials. Hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural are biomass-derived platform chemicals that have received attention as raw materials due to their chemical functionality, renewability, and capability to produce various furan-containing building blocks. In this work, we aim to develop a synthetic methodology starting from biomass-derived chemicals to design potential optoelectronics. Hydroxymethylfurfural was studied to develop multi-arylated furans; however, a rigid diol monomer was synthesized instead. Working with methyl-5-bromofuran-2-carboxylate led to three different multi-arylated furans via regioselective halogenations followed by Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. 5-Bromofurfural, a close derivative of biomass-derived furfural, was an ideal candidate to produce ten 2,5-furan-based oligomers and one 2,5-furan-based push-pull chromophore. To rapidly extend the π-conjugation of each material, a double Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative cross-coupling (DCC) reaction was utilized. This strategy fuses two nucleophilic arylated furan acids with a dihalogenated aryl linker to produce highly planar furan-based oligomers. Regarding overall yields of the double DCC, electron-neutral and electron-donating furan acids exhibited higher yields (32 – 74%) than electron-withdrawing acid derivatives (18 – 21%). All furan-based compounds were then characterized by NMR and their absorbance, photoluminescence and quantum yields were studied in dilute solution.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The province of Québec is often not included or under-studied in research regarding blackface minstrelsy, but it would be fallacious to assume that its underrepresentation in publicly accessible archives equates its non-existence. Blackface minstrelsy is a racist theatrical form in which white actors and musicians, the minstrels, would apply burnt cork to their faces and perform derogatory stereotypes of Black people in front of white audiences. As Cheryl Thompson argues, white Canadians reproduced American minstrelsy, not to soothe class fears, but in response to their fears about Black immigration and their supposed inability to assimilate into Canadian culture. Looking specifically at Montréal, blackness was used as a satirical tool to debase francophone bodies, which were deemed “other” to the Anglo-Saxon English-speaking majority at the time. Henri Julien’s Songs of the By-Town Coons exemplifies how blackface minstrelsy imagery found its way into mainstream media and the width of its popularity.
Located in the Jewish Public Library archives, the Young Men/Women Hebrew Association (YM-YWHA) and the Irving Silverman fonds contain a plethora of photographs and documents related to their very own minstrels, which were part of their musical programme. Examining the YMHA minstrels as a case study allows for the first in-depth analysis of this troupe and for situating it within the broader context of Canadian blackface minstrelsy. This project then observes the role of the performances and their recording in the Jewish community’s own archives as a necessity for self-representation while simultaneously highlighting the pride they took in their performances.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This paper builds upon prior work on vertical interactions in the drug supply chain in the United States. There is limited research to date seeking to model these vertical relationships, particularly in the presence of generic substitute availability. We begin with a model based on Conti et al. (2021), where two branded drug manufacturers compete for preferred formulary placement by offering rebates to a monopolist pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), and add a generic drug whose price is non-negotiable. Additionally, we allow for consumer heterogeneity in terms of willingness to sacrifice perceived quality in exchange for cost savings when deciding between a branded or generic drug. We show that an equilibrium exists whereby the PBM sets the copayment for the generic drug higher than that of the preferred brand in exchange for higher rebates and examine how the incentives produced by the formulary contest may lead PBMs to discourage generic uptake.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Un coup d’œil sur la bande dessinée nous montre que ce genre littéraire peut non seulement servir d’outil de réflexion sur la traduction d’éléments visuels, mais, grâce à son langage imagé, il offre également une visibilité à des langues en quête de reconnaissance telles que le créole mauricien (le mauricien). Dans cette analyse de la traduction de Tintin, plus précisément l’album Le Secret de La Licorne, nous souhaitons mettre de l’avant une approche plutôt récente en traductologie, la multimodalité, qui permet d’étudier à la loupe la combinaison entre différents modes de communication, que ce soit la langue verbale, des éléments visuels ou d’autres modes qui ont pour but de communiquer un sens. Comme le but ultime de ce mémoire est de démontrer l’autonomie d’une langue telle que le mauricien, il est nécessaire d’intégrer dans cette analyse multimodale une autre approche qui permet de contextualiser ces modes lors du processus de traduction. La sociosémiotique est une approche qui combine le sens et le social, ce qui fait d’elle un outil efficace pour analyser ces modes lorsqu’ils sont transférés dans un nouveau contexte, et ainsi déterminer ce que leur transfert implique pour la traduction elle-même, mais aussi pour le créole mauricien. Finalement, ce que ce mémoire souhaite également montrer, c’est l’importance de prendre considération le non-dit, l’espace entre les mots, pour que rien n’échappe à l’entendement.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Embracing the "Freer Other Thing": Metaphor is a Portal to Imaginative Play and Ludic Learning</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Cowan, Cierra</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>metaphor, ludic pedagogy, literary pedagogy, play, memoir, communication, learning</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis braids knowledge across different disciplines into an argument for learning and teaching through play, via metaphor and memoir. It examines the memoir of the classically trained pianist Jeremy Denk, Every Good Boy Does Fine: A Love Story, in Music Lessons, as both a pedagogical case study and a literary narrative, with particular attention given to the role of metaphor as a tool for ludic learning and communication. My reading shows that it is play, and especially the playful use of deliberate metaphors, that unlocks Denk’s most effective, meaningful performances as both musician and writer. Metaphor, I argue, can act as the cognitive gateway into imaginative play, allowing for learning, creation, and communication, even in a multimodal context. Furthermore, Denk’s use of deliberate metaphor in piano playing and literary writing suggests that metaphor can function as both intra-communication (i.e., within oneself) and inter-communication (between two or more people); this is an extension of Gerard J. Steen’s “new and improved” contemporary theory of metaphor, which proposes adding communication as a third dimension to George Lakoff’s two-dimensional thought-language framework. Then, in the last section of the thesis, I dive into my own act of memoir- and metaphor-driven playful learning. I consider my budding ideas on a ludic literary pedagogy with support from the current scholarship, focusing on three aspects: inclusivity, literary criticism as a ludic practice, and play-based classroom activities (inspired by Denk).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Cranston, Cheyenne M.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The moral judgements we make, and how we make them, have a critical impact on our ability to function in any social groups we are part of. They are informed by a plethora of social factors, but less is known about how the way moral judgements are formed may vary between individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their neurotypical peers. Previous research suggests autistic individuals may differ in the way they form and implement moral judgements, however, often the way these studies are implemented do not play to strengths of autistic individuals.
This study gathered qualitative data from four typically developing and four autistic 7–10-year-old children, using a novel task that asked them to consider four scenarios focused on peer altercations in a school context. Each scenario manipulated different information about the victims and the perpetrators, to determine if there was any variation between the two groups in the way this information was interpreted and used toward forming a moral judgement. Many similarities were found between groups, as well as several variations that suggest there may be different underlying assumptions between the two groups about the information given in each scenario. These variations were most salient in the areas of apologizing, the accidental nature of the incident, focusing on specific story details, and focusing on others’ feelings and intentions. These findings indicate that autistic individuals may hold different assumptions about the world around them that influence their interpretation of moral scenarios.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This master's thesis explores the educational and social approaches to addressing psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in Québec. By examining current educational curricula and integrating restorative practices suggestions, the study highlights how changes in educational frameworks can contribute to reducing IPV in society (especially psychological IPV). Through a combination of a literature review and qualitative data analysis derived from interviews with IPV victims and social workers, this research identifies key strategies for promoting awareness about and prevention of psychological IPV. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating these practices into educational systems to foster a more supportive and responsive approach to psychological IPV.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The blond capuchin (Sapajus flavius) is an Endangered species of capuchin monkey largely confined to Atlantic Forest fragments in northeastern Brazil, where dispersal is restricted, and resources are limited. In this thesis, I investigated how the spatial cohesion and group movements of blond capuchins were affected by the conditions of the forest fragment they inhabited. My first manuscript (Chapter 2) focused on forest strata use (for age/sex classes), and group cohesion according to the strata used. My second manuscript (Chapter 3) looked at group movement and leadership in age/sex classes. My study site was a 90 hectare forest fragment located on the border of the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco in Brazil (7°52'85,2"S; 34°96'29,4"O), with a group of ~120 blond capuchins. My collaborators and I collected 633 group scans samples, with 15119 individual observations (October 2021 to July 2022), recording age, sex, location and behaviour of each individual. I found that capuchin use of forest strata varied among age/sex classes, a finding that suggests behavioural adjustments to avoid direct competition in this small fragment. I found that capuchin group movement could be characterized as two waves, with adults in the front wave and juveniles in the back wave, a finding that suggests adults reach preferred foods before juveniles. My work contributes to our understanding of how capuchins use forest fragments and underscores the need for further research in forest fragments to better inform conservation practices for this and other threatened primate species, and the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forests.</etd_ms:description>

While promising results have been achieved in previous works, there is no consensus on an optimal model for accurate prediction or clinical utility. This thesis proposes using supervised contrastive learning with Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss and Grad-RAM for explainability utilizing structural T1w MRI data. Results indicate that the supervised contrastive strategy significantly outperformed ResNet models, achieving a mean absolute error of 4.28 years and an R² of 0.93 with a limited dataset of aging subjects. Benchmark comparisons with state-of-the-art models demonstrated that the supervised contrastive approach achieved comparable performance in our test sample, particularly among older age groups. The Grad-RAM analysis revealed anatomically relevant regions associated with aging, with the more nuanced capabilities exhibited by the supervised contrastive learning approach. Analyses of disease populations revealed significantly higher brain age gaps in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients, correlating strongly with ADAS-cog scores (r = 0.37, p = 0.0098), suggesting its potential as a biomarker for assessing AD severity. However, no significant correlation was found between brain age gap and UPDRSIII scores in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The Grad-RAM focuses on regions known to be linked to AD and PD, but with little difference to the healthy population. Our study demonstrates the potential of supervised contrastive learning with an RNC loss in brain age prediction, highlighting its ability to outperform other models in smaller datasets.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Measuring metabolites produced by large libraries of metabolically engineered yeast requires high throughput screening technology. Current screening methods use mass spectrometry to measure metabolites. Higher throughput detection methods are available, however they rely on fluorescent detection. Measuring non-fluorescent metabolites requires an alternative detection method integrated in the screening system. Herein, we introduce an electrochemical sensor, that can be integrated with droplet microfluidics to detect a key branch point molecule in opiate biosynthesis: (S)-reticuline, which is produced by metabolically engineered yeast. This platform technology could be used to screen a heterogenous library consisting of engineered yeast that secrete (S)-reticuline. Demonstrating that yeast cells in a population, which produce high titers of (S)-reticuline can be detected using this screening system will open the door to screening libraries of micro-organisms that produce other electroactive, non-fluorescent secreted metabolites.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Urban greenspaces are often intended for the use of people and wildlife; however, balancing the dual priorities and needs of people and wildlife from these spaces can be challenging. In the two chapters of this thesis, I investigated the impact of human activity on avian nesting success, diversity, and community structure. In my first chapter, I assessed whether human presence in urban greenspaces influences the nest survival of common species of open- cup shrub nesting birds on the island of Montreal. We conducted a field study in the summer of 2023 to collect data on bird diversity and nest survival on the island of Montreal. Through this work, we found that human activity did not significantly influence bird nest survival. In my second chapter I assessed how the presence of trails and human activity are related to bird species richness, diversity, and composition in both formally and informally managed urban greenspaces. We found that bird communities further from trails, as well as in informal urban greenspaces, were the most diverse; however, we did not find a relationship between the number of people using trails and bird diversity. This work provides land and urban greenspace managers with integrated science advice to help them support access to nature for people while maintaining existing avian biodiversity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Memes are an increasingly popular medium for self-expression in a digital context. On the social media site Instagram, queer and politically-left meme creators are subverting hegemonic power dynamics to present humorous and original memes, with sincere self-representation at their core: what I designate, alternative Instagram memes. Queer people often face discrimination and social exclusion in their local communities, exacerbated by the isolating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which leads many to seek out and forge digital communities of their own. In this research-creation project, I analyze the themes and discourse present in alternative Instagram memes posted by myself and by my peers to examine how this content and the community around it forms a digital intimate public. The expansion of #deardiarymemes, an interactive meme project based on anonymous confessions, exemplifies how memes function as digital storytelling tools and is central to this research. Through a curated series of memes by myself and by my peers as well as 41 new #deardiarymemes, this work builds on existing meme scholarship using feminist theorypractice to present a previously unstudied aspect of meme culture: a subversive, leftist meme community sprouting from the social media site Instagram.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>A Comparative Study of the Eschatological Differences between Roman Catholic and Baptist Traditions

Christopher Dagher

Roman Catholics and Evangelical Baptists have always theologically differed regarding end times beliefs. On one side the quasi-totality of Catholics has an Amillennial view against a large proportion of Evangelicals that opt for Dispensational Premillennialism. However, from their respective beginnings, a common set of doctrines has been Christ's Second Coming (Parousia), the bodily resurrection, and the final judgement. Numerous theologians throughout the ages have contributed their input to enrich Christianity with their eschatological perspectives, many of which have been utilized for different political endeavors. A plethora of statistics have been recorded to quantify the American sentiment on several questions. One example is that 92% of American Evangelicals “believe Jesus will return to Earth someday” versus 63% for Catholics. Finally, Evangelicals and Catholics have found common ground today to pursue ecumenical efforts against what they perceive as a growing wave of immorality in America.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Assessing the Contribution of the Global Fund in the fight against Malaria: A case of sub-Sahara Africa and Southeast Asia Economies.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Darko, Henry</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the effectiveness of Global Fund financing in malaria control in sub-Sahara Africa and Southeast Asia regions using a sixteen year dataset from 2005 to 2020. Employing quantitative methods and non-experimental descriptive research design, the study found that Global Fund exerts significant negative impact on incidence of malaria in sub-Sahara Africa and Southeast Asia. In addition, the findings show that education, country policy and institution assessment, and gross domestic product are key factors influencing the effectiveness of the Global Fund financing for malaria control within sub-Sahara Africa and Southeast Asia regions. In relation to sub-Sahara Africa the study found that Global Fund, education, country policy and institution assessment, and gross domestic product exert significant negative impact on malaria incidence. However, in Southeast Asia, Global Fund, education, and gross domestic product failed to exert significant statistical impact on malaria incidence with the exception of country policy and institution assessment which showed negative impact on malaria incidence. These findings have implications for the international donor community and the health sector authorities of countries in the territories used for this study, as this would contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat malaria and improve global health outcomes. In conclusion, the study highlight the need for region-specific approaches that consider local socio-economic and political contexts, suggesting that a “one-size-fits-all” model is less effective in global malaria control.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Risk-Averse Policy Gradient for Tail Risk Optimization Using Extreme Value Theory</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Davar, Parisa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this work, we develop a risk-averse Policy Gradient algorithm in a tail risk optimization problem. Our objective is to find the optimal policy that minimizes tail risk, given a risk measure such as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). We employed Extreme Value Theory, along with the automated threshold method to manage risks associated with extreme events. This paper is the first to integrate EVT within risk-averse policy gradient RL algorithms for sequential decision making. To evaluate our approach, we initially test it on simulated data generated from heavytailed distributions, including the Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) and the Burr distribution. Subsequently, we applied our method to address a hedging problem, aiming to mitigate exceedingly high risks and finding optimal gamma hedging strategies within a highly volatile market where options are notably expensive. This involves identifying the optimal proportion of gamma to hedge, while minimizing costs and risk associated with gamma hedging errors. Also, we utilize the finite difference method to approximate the gradient of the estimated CVaR. The experimental results indicate convergence in the policy, CVaR estimation, and the gradient approximation of estimated CVaR. Moreover, integrating Extreme Value Theory into risk-averse policy gradient methods significantly improves performance, especially in markets characterized by an underlying asset following a Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution (NIG), known for its pure-jump semi-heavy tail distribution.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, I seek to articulate queerness as an embodied politic and poetic of disorientation I call the gesture, which I locate within the works and my encounters with Agnes Martin, Marlow Moss, and Catherine Opie. Here, through both visual analysis, critical theory, embodied experience and its memory, I illuminate queer aspects and potentialities of encounters with works of art not through indicting the body of viewer (myself), the artists I discuss, nor the particular aesthetics of their works towards the production of a stable archive, but rather through the ephemeral and disorienting encounters of identification both found and challenged in the works of art I discuss. In my methodology, I seek to maintain a poetic posture of opacity and respect the refusal I locate in these works and in myself, as I engage auto theory. My thesis seeks to articulate queerness as a plurality of strategy and embodiment, through describing my experiences and analyses of the works of Agnes Martin, Marlow Moss, and Catherine Opie—three artists who mean a great deal to me, as a queer subject.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Proof Recommendation for the HOL4 Theorem Prover</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Dekhil, Nour</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Interactive theorem proving is a complex process that often requires significant expertise, user intervention and deep domain knowledge, making it challenging for users to construct valid proofs. The HOL4 theorem prover, while a powerful tool in formal verification, presents usability challenges due to the intricate nature of proofs and the cognitive load placed on users. This thesis proposes an innovative solution to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of interactive theorem proving through the development of an AI-driven Proof Recommendation System that leverages Large Language Models. The proposed methodology focuses on two primary tasks: proof step recommendation and complete proof generation. For the proof step recommendation, models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and T5 were fine-tuned on datasets derived from HOL4 theories to predict the next logical step(s) in the proof construction. This capability aims to guide users through the proof process, making it less daunting and more manageable, especially for those with a limited experience. In the proof generation task, sequence-to-sequence models, including MarianMT and T5, were utilized to generate complete proof sequences based on the given theorem statements. This task is particularly challenging due to a need to capture complex logical patterns and ensure the validity of the generated proofs. The training involved rigorous hyper-parameter tuning and evaluation to optimize the performance of models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach not only reduces the cognitive load on theorem provers but also enhances the efficiency and accessibility of interactive theorem proving compared to related work. The tool, called HOL4PRS, achieves significant accuracy in recommending proof steps and generating proof sequences, facilitating more widespread adoption of HOL4 in critical verification tasks across various industries. This thesis contributes to the field by showcasing how integrating AI into formal verification processes can significantly advance the capabilities and applications of the interactive theorem provers.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Scream: une autoréflexion des mécanismes d’identifications à travers le slasher postmoderne</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Cette thèse démontre de quelles manières une analyse postmoderne de la quadrilogie cinématographique Scream (Wes Craven, 1996-2011) révèle des mécanismes d’identification plus fluide que celles développées dans les études des slashers modernes. Nous allons démontrer de quelles manières ces mécanismes se voient reconfigurer par une lecture de la série de Wes Craven en tant que pastiche du slasher des années 1970 et 1980. Comment le pastiche, qui est « une forme d’autoréfléxivité moderne employée par de multiples films d’horreur afin de remettre en question les notions formelles dominantes du genre du film d'horreur et leur fondement idéologique » (Benshoff), peut-il ouvrir une nouvelle lecture d’identification performative du genre entretenue dans les études du slasher moderne? En analysant des moments et figures clefs de la franchise, nous affirmons que le public reconnaît les mécanismes d’identification typique du slasher afin de s’y distancer et d'entretenir une projection renouvelée dans le slasher postmoderne. Afin de parvenir à nos fins, nous nous appuyons sur les concepts de pastiche, de parodie, et de performance de genre. Nous étudions également des approches queer au cinéma d’horreur, ainsi que la littérature concernant directement Scream et le slasher. Ces notions seront analysées et mises en discussion, notamment par le biais d’études féministes séminaires comprenant celles de Carol J. Clover, Isabel C. Pinedo, Linda Williams, Sarah Trecansky, et Barbara Creed, parmi plusieurs autres.

This thesis demonstrates the ways in which a postmodern analysis of the Scream cinematic quadrilogy (Wes Craven, 1996-2011) allows for more fluid identification mechanisms than those developed in studies of modern slashers films. We will demonstrate the ways in which these mechanisms are reconfigured by a reading of Wes Craven's series as a pastiche of the 1970s and 1980s slasher film. How can pastiche, which is “a form of modern self-reflexivity employed by multiple horror films to challenge the dominant formal notions of the horror film genre and their ideological underpinning” (Benshoff), can open up a new reading of performative gender identification, supported in studies of the modern slasher? By analyzing key moments and figures within the franchise, we argue that audiences recognize typical slasher identification mechanisms in order to distance themselves from them and maintain a renewed projection of the self into the postmodern slasher. For that purpose, we draw on concepts of pastiche and parody, gender performativity, approaches to queer horror, slasher studies, as well as literature relating directly to Scream. These notions will be analyzed and discussed, notably through the lens of key feminist horror studies, including but not limited to Carol J. Clover, Isabel C. Pinedo, Linda Williams, Sarah Trencansky, and  Barbara Creed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>A proof of solvency (or proof of reserves) is a zero-knowledge proof conducted by centralized cryptocurrency exchange to offer evidence that the exchange owns enough cryptocurrency to settle each of its users' balances. The proof seeks to reveal nothing about the finances of the exchange or its users, only the fact that it is solvent. The literature has already started to explore how to make proof size and verifier time independent of the number of (i) users on the exchange, and (ii) addresses used by the exchange. We argue there are a few areas of improvement. First, we propose and implement a full end-to-end argument that is fast for the exchange to prove (minutes), small in size (KBs), and fast to verify (seconds). Second, we deal with the natural conflict between Bitcoin and Ethereum's cryptographic setting (secp256k1) and more ideal settings for succinctness (e.g., pairing-based cryptography) with a novel mapping approach. Finally, we discuss how to adapt the protocol to the concrete parameters of bls12-381 (which is relevant because the bit-decomposition of all user balances will exceed the largest root of unity of the curve for even moderately-sized exchanges).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Gay Steel Mill: Queer Oral Histories of Deindustrializing Cape Breton</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Devitt, Liam</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Queer history in Canada has often centred around metropolitan areas, like Toronto and Montreal, usually foregrounding social movements. This means that queer histories of the periphery are often overlooked, and that histories of metropole are taken as representative of the national context. In this thesis, I examine queer oral histories of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Through these oral histories I aim to complicate dominant narratives in both queer history and histories of deindustrialization in Canada. Cape Breton is a former steel and coal region in Nova Scotia that underwent a comparatively slow, state-managed deindustrialization in the latter half of the 20th century. Today, like in deindustrialized areas across the world, the “structure of feeling” of industrial life remains, despite plant and mine closure. Often, histories of deindustrialization center around a mythologized white male (and indubitably heterosexual) breadwinner, centering not just workers, but the specific function that masculine industrial labour played in the social reproduction of the Fordist accord in the household. By taking up the life stories of queer people, we can critically examine this centring of the nuclear family in deindustrialization studies. In the first chapter, I offer a theoretical and historiographical intervention arguing for a queer investigation of deindustrialization. In the second chapter, I apply this line of thinking to oral histories of Cape Breton queers, arguing that these narrators’ desires for queer history and queer future are ultimately filtered through  the prism of deindustrialization’s half-life.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The behaviour of small caps in emerging markets has not received much attention in the academic literature. For international investors, they pose particular problems to the extent that their returns reflect political risks, and fiscal and monetary instability that give rise to inflationary pressures. This paper looks at the diversification benefits of small cap returns across emerging market countries, taking into account their exposure to inflation. The paper finds that for many of the countries with lower-than-average inflation, adding their small cap stocks to a benchmark US large-cap portfolio expands the mean variance frontier of the benchmark portfolio. This finding is robust to the effects of the Global Financial Crisis to an extent. Diversification benefits of small cap stocks are rare for emerging countries with higher inflation, and not seen at all for the post GFC period.</etd_ms:description>

 A numerical study</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>MCrAlY powder where M stands for Nickel (Ni) or Cobalt (Co) is extensively used in the aerospace industry as a bond coat for its corrosion and oxidation resistant characteristics. MCrAlY can sustain prolonged exposure to high temperatures such as in gas turbines. The aluminum present predominantly in the β-phase of the alloy forms a protective oxide called aluminum oxide or alumina. This latter acts as a barrier for further oxidation provided that there is no chemical breakdown resulting in the formation of non-protective oxides.
Numerical analyses have been made in place to predict the degree of oxidation of the feedstock during their flight in thermal spray processes. The most prominent is the Mott and Cabrera theory developed in 1944. The theory stipulates that the film oxide can be associated with three growth processes/thicknesses namely, very thin films, thin films, and thick films. The in-flight oxidation of particles is proven to be in the order of milliseconds, hence only very thin films are formed. In this range of thickness, the oxidation is driven by the presence of a strong electric field.
High velocity air-fuel (HVAF) has revolutionized the very exclusive group of solid-state deposition. The process comes in with the promise of reducing the particle temperature while increasing their velocity with the stated goal of diminishing the oxidation and enhancing the adhesion particle-substrate. The combination of HVAF and MCrAlY delivers qualitative coatings with low oxide content and a longer lifespan. The numerical modeling of the in-flight oxidation of the particles is validated by examining the oxide layer thickness using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Machine Learning Approaches for Anomaly Detection and Load Forecasting in Smart Buildings Time Series Data</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Dissem, Maher</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The proliferation of IoT sensors in smart buildings has enabled extensive time-series data collection, providing valuable insights for predictive maintenance, operational efficiency, and energy management. This data can be used within an anomaly detection framework to automatically identify abnormal behaviors, enabling the detection of issues related to power consumption, control system failures, and sensor malfunctions. Additionally, it supports load forecasting, crucial for optimizing energy management by enabling efficient resource allocation, cost savings, and sustainable operations through accurate demand prediction. However, IoT devices are prone to issues like hardware malfunctions and transmission errors, which introduce data anomalies and complicate the effective use of collected data. A popular and effective anomaly detection framework trains autoencoders on minimizing the error between original and reconstructed sequences. By setting a threshold on the reconstruction error, abnormal sequences can be distinguished from the predominant regular patterns. However, this method is highly sensitive to architectural parameters and the nature of anomalies, making it difficult to develop a universally effective method or fine-tune a model without prior knowledge of the building and sensors settings. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning-based neural architecture search approach to explore a manually defined search space and identify the optimal neural configuration through trial and error. While this method demonstrates competitive performance in discovering effective architectures that may be not intuitive, it assumes the availability of anomaly-free data for training, which is not practical in real-world scenarios. Hence, we also present an unsupervised feature bank-based model for anomaly detection in anomaly-contaminated time series. We integrate this with a recurrent denoising autoencoder, trained on data deemed anomaly-free, to replace identified anomalies with plausible patterns. This results in a combined anomaly detection and imputation pipeline that preprocesses data for downstream tasks, such as forecasting, in which we compare the performance of different models before and after preprocessing and demonstrate significant improvements. Despite these advancements, data scarcity remains a challenge in training effective load forecasting models for smart buildings, specially that concerns over the privacy of IoT sensor data make building owners reluctant to share their data, whether for transfer learning or for centralized model training, as it can reveal sensitive information about the occupants’ behaviors. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a federated load forecasting framework to exploit data from multiple buildings while maintaining data privacy. Acknowledging the diverse load profiles shaped by factors like size, location, and user behavior, we also investigate existing techniques to personalize the global model to accommodate each building’s specific characteristics.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Doheney, Bianca</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets are found in most North American households and are being used by preteens to communicate with peers, watch videos on YouTube, play videogames, and become familiar with social media. Social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat are attracting children’s attention with the onsetting age of social media use becoming younger every year. The aim of the following study was to better understand how preteens (1) engage with handheld devices and (2) perceive handheld devices and the social, emotional, and physical impact they might have. I conducted a multiple case study where multiple sources of information were gathered to illustrate two preteens’ real-life experiences owning a hand-held device. Semi-structured interviews, journal entries and digital technology were used to gather data from a preteen, their parent(s), and teacher. Findings revealed that devices are mostly used by preteens to play games and stay connected with friends and family. Preteens, parents, and teachers all shared conflicting feelings and were able to recognize both the positive and negative in preteen’s use of handheld devices. Better understanding how preteens are impacted by our digital world will hopefully better equip us to create well-developed programs to enhance children’s media literacy habits and awareness.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>How Do Institutional Pressures Shape the Experiences of Plus-Size Consumers in the Fashion Markets of Canada and Iran?</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Doorandish, Mahsa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study investigates the experiences of plus-size consumers in the fashion markets of Cana-da and Iran, highlighting some of the exclusionary practices within the industry that limit con-sumer access to fashionable and well-fitting clothes. Through a qualitative approach mix of in-depth interviews and netnography, this research explores how coercive, normative, and mimetic institutional pressures form the experiences of plus-size people within these two diverse mar-kets. This study analyzes these pressures to show how cultural, economic, and political ele-ments combine to exclude plus-size consumers, especially in the non-Western contexts of Iran, where economic sanctions make market limitations even worse. This is important because plus-size consumers face great difficulties in general, and plus-size men often do not get attention when it comes to fashion research. Moreover, this research underlines the role of representation in marketing: the visibility of plus-size models can positively influence the self-esteem and con-fidence of consumers. This paper adds to the existing literature on consumer exclusion and fashion through a comparative analysis between the plus-size fashion markets of Canada and Iran. The contributions of this research are at once theoretical, in developing the intersection of institutional theory and consumer exclusion, and practical, with implications for fashion brands, policymakers, and advocates of inclusivity. This study highlights the call for body size inclusiv-ity and shows how one-size-fits-all in plus-size fashion cannot fulfill the many needs that plus-size varied shapes may require. It thus advocates for an approach to fashion that is more inclu-sive and diverse through uptake in custom-designed pieces, increased marketing representation, and policy reforms that will ensure access to these excluded consumers.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Integrating Vision-Language Models with Reinforcement
Learning for Human-Aligned Decision-Making of
Autonomous Vehicles</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Doroudian, Erfan</etd_ms:creator>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis focuses on developing a new approach for improving the decision-making process
for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in complex urban driving scenarios, particularly at unsignalized
intersections, using the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. One of the primary difficulties
in RL environments is designing a suitable reward model, which can often be challenging to
achieve manually due to the complexity of the interactions and the driving scenarios. To address
this challenge, this work utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP (Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining), to build an additional reward model based on visual and textual cues.
CLIP’s ability to align image and text embeddings provides unique features for translating humanlike
instructions into reward signals to guide the AV’s decision-making process. We apply two RL
algorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN), to train an agent in
complex unsignalized intersection environments. The performance of these algorithms is compared
with and without the CLIP-based reward model, which highlights the impact of CLIP on the agent’s
ability to learn and optimize its behavior in a way that aligns with desired driving actions. This
study’s results show VLMs’ capabilities in improving RL-based decision-making in autonomous
driving. We utilize the Highway-env simulation package, built on the OpenAI Gym framework, to
test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our simulation experiments indicate
the framework’s effectiveness in optimizing traffic flow, minimizing collisions, and balancing both
individual and collective benefits among road users. The results highlight the potential of integrating
VLMs to provide human-aligned instructions, which could guide autonomous vehicle actions
toward safer and more socially acceptable behaviors and eventually promote AVs’ safe and trustable
deployment in future intelligent transportation systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines Remote Control II (1989), a wearable sculpture by multidisciplinary artist Jana Sterbak. The sculpture references cage crinoline, a popular garment in Europe that was a staple in women’s wardrobes from 1856 until the late 1800s. Visually mimicking a birdcage, the sartorial style prioritized an idealized femininity, enforcing corporeal, cultural, and social control over the female body through immobilization, constriction, and threatening livelihoods. Remote Control II mimics this silhouette with added material and formal elements that highlight the crinoline’s controlling intention. Informed by feminist and queer methodologies and design histories, this thesis argues that Remote Control II is subversive in reappropriating the cage crinoline and transforming the silhouette into one that may offer agency and autonomy. To demonstrate my argument, I analyze the cage crinoline’s history, the broader cultural significance of clothing, and Sterbak’s reinterpretation to highlight how Remote Control II is effective in subverting the cage crinoline’s history through appropriation, material choices, and complicating gendered design elements. This thesis concludes by exploring Remote Control II’s relevance in our contemporary context at a time in which the dress no longer stands for singular femininity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The health span of construction workers is reduced by the nature of their work. Over the course of their careers, workers in the construction trades are set to face environments and tasks that put them at risk for debilitating musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). The emerging technology of occupational exoskeletons (OEs) offers a promising solution. OEs are wearable ergonomic tools designed to prevent work-related MSDs, particularly in the industries of manufacturing and logistics. The construction industry is uniquely placed to benefit from OEs due to the intensity and variation of construction environments and tasks that prevent the implementation of interventions that are available in more controlled settings. This intensity and variation, however, complicates the process of designing and evaluating OEs for construction applications. Following from a comprehensive literature review on OEs for the construction trades, this research aims to address a gap in the existing body of knowledge that acts as a barrier to OE adoption in construction: a lack of realistic trade-specific standard test methods to evaluate OEs for the construction trades. A novel test method is developed and implemented in a controlled environment to evaluate back-support OEs for the essential trade of reinforcing ironworkers, and insights from the implementation suggest improvements for future test methods. A pilot field study is conducted to investigate the realism of the proposed test method. Based on the literature review, test method design and implementation, and pilot field study, a roadmap is proposed towards the large-scale adoption of effective OEs in the construction industry via general and trade-specific standard tests.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Dô-Chastenay, Kim Lan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Ce mémoire est une traduction commentée, de l’anglais vers le français, de six chapitres du roman Butter Honey Pig Bread écrit par Francesca Ekwuyasi et publié en 2020 chez Arsenal Pulp Press. Le texte de départ, en anglais, est hétérolingue, c’est-à-dire qu’en plus de l’anglais, le pidgin nigérian, le français et l’igbo sont présents, surtout dans les dialogues. C’est donc l’hétérolinguisme qui constitue la principale difficulté du texte et qui fait l’objet d’un commentaire poussé. Une stratégie de traduction différente est élaborée et expliquée pour quatre types d’hétérolinguisme relevés dans le texte : les realia, les interjections, les phrases complètes en pidgin et le français. Une des particularités du texte de départ est que presque aucune traduction ou explication n’est fournie pour les mots et phrases dans une langue autre que l’anglais. Le contexte permet de comprendre en général de quoi on parle, mais il reste un flou pour le lectorat qui ne parle pas le pidgin, l’igbo ou le français. En traduction, le même parti pris a été choisi, ce qui revient à ne pas traduire ou expliquer les phrases en pidgin et en igbo et à présenter ces phrases « étrangères » au lectorat francophone de la même façon qu’elles ont été présentées au lectorat anglophone. Cette stratégie de traduction a été conçue dans une optique postcoloniale où on cherche à investir une langue dominante d’éléments de la culture minoritaire, en l’occurrence nigériane, sans pour autant la servir sur un plateau d’argent, l’effacer ou l’exotiser.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>License Plate Detection and Character Recognition using Deep Learning and Font Evaluation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ebrahimi Vargoorani, Zahra</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>License plate detection and character recognition pose challenges due  to environmental 
sensitivity, such as lighting, dust, and the impact of the chosen font type on recognition 
tasks.  Automatic  License  Plate  Detection  and  Recognition  (ALPR)  are  crucial 
in  practical  applications  such  as  traffic  control  and  parking,  vehicle  tracking,  toll 
collection,  and  law  enforcement.  While  much  research  has  been  done  using  image 
processing  and  machine  learning  algorithms,  deep  learning  methods  need  further 
exploration  due  to  their  recent  advances  in  reliable  performance  in  various  scenarios. 
Moreover, current proposals are limited to specific regions and dataset applicability. 
This  study  has  a  dual  focus:  firstly, we  suggest  utilizing  a Deep  Learning  technique, 
specifically  using Faster R-CNN  for  the  license  plate  detection  task  and  a CNN-RNN 
model  with  CTC  loss,  and  a MobileNet  V3  backbone  for  recognition  task. We  also 
utilized You Only Look Once (YOLO) for license plate detection and recognition tasks. 
Secondly, we aim to assess font features within the LP context. This work uses Brazilian 
dataset and datasets from  two different provinces  in Canada and two different states  in 
the  United  States  of America,  including  Ontario,  Quebec,  California,  and  New York 
State. We  suggest  employing  an  adaptive  algorithm  based  on Faster R-CNN  and CTC 
network  along  with  YOLO,  fine-tuned  with  optimized  parameters  to  improve  its 
effectiveness  using  two  different  approaches,  including  domain  generalization. 
Alongside  presenting  the  recall  ratio  findings,  this  study will perform a  thorough error 
analysis  to  gain  insights  into  the  nature  of  false  positives.  The  proposed  model 
demonstrated a commendable recall ratio of 94% using a single YOLO network. 
Specific  fonts  pose  readability  challenges  for humans, while  others  present  difficulties 
for  computer  systems  regarding  recognition.  In  this  study,  we  provide  five  sets  of 
outcomes  for  font  assessment:  results  about  font  anatomy  and  those  related  to  the 
recognition of commercial products. The font anatomy analysis focuses on five specific 
fonts: Driver Gothic, Dreadnought, California Clarendon, Zurich Extra Condensed, and 
Mandatory. Additionally, we assess  the  impact of these fonts  in the context of a dataset 
made of five different  license plates using a commercial product, OpenALPR. The font 
anatomy findings unveil significant confusion cases and quality features associated with 
chosen fonts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Video Games, Cinemafication, Film, Genre Studies, Medium</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Films and video games may initially seem to have more elements in common than not, but upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the two audio/visual mediums are equally as different as they are similar. An effective method to facilitate a lucrative comparative analysis is to examine the two mediums through the lens of shared genres. Game scholars, such as King, Krzywinska, and Wolf, have long argued how to best analyze the topic of genre within the medium of games, and by combining concepts from these texts with the work of film theorists, including Neale and Schatz, this thesis aims to introduce a novel system of generic classification that allows for a better comparison between similar films and games and a closer examination of how games utilize genre. Through the direct comparison of films and games, it becomes apparent that as the video game industry has evolved, games have gradually become more recognizably cinematic, a phenomenon that this thesis dubs as cinemafication, which can best be identified as the consistent trend of video game graphics and narratives increasing in complexity, allowing for more cinematic potential, thereby closing the gap between the mediums of film and games. By closely examining generic case studies of the action and gangster genres, this thesis will apply a novel system of generic categorization in order to explore the intricacies of how genres are affected by the medium through which they are presented.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Development and analysis of two innovative physical and chemical co2 absotprion systems to achieve a more effective ccu process</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>El Helou, Mourad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Human activities have caused a continuous increase in global temperatures due to high global 
greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated 
that to reduce these emissions carbon capture and utilization (CCU) must be implemented, despite 
its energy-intensive nature. In this project, various innovative approaches have been developed to 
improve the performance of solvent based absorption systems and their integration with CCU. The 
reduction in energy is achieved by hydrogen injection into the CO2 removal separators to act as a 
stripping agent. Nine configurations (4 physical, 5 chemical) are simulated and analyzed. 
Furthermore, the proposed approaches are tested for two scenarios: 1) CO2 capture from the flue
gas of a cement plant. 2) revamping the CO2 capture unit of the synthesis gas stream of an existing 
ammonia plant. The results for physical absorption revealed that around 48%-77% reduction in 
the net energy consumption for flue gas and syngas are achievable respectively compared to the 
base case capture process and the traditional processes available in the market. As a result, the 
capture cost has decreased by 10%-25%, for flue gas and syngas respectively ($80.92/$29.43 from 
$89.34/$39 per tonne CO2). In the chemical case, the proposed concept is integrated with the use 
of high-temperature heat pump. According to our results, a 13% improvement for flue gas and 5% 
for syngas in the coefficient of performance of the heat pump is achievable. The results of this 
project can be used to improve the overall performance of the CCU technologies and to be 
compared with other emerging technologies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This project involved studying photosynthetic pigment molecules and had two distinct 
sections of the project: an experimental part and a computational part. 
Throughout the experimental part of this project we explored several different 
modifications to our experimental setup to overcome a lack of flatness and repeatability in 
our sample. We realized that there may have been non-elastic properties to the gaskets we 
were using, and we found that CLIC microscopy was not suitable for our purposes. 
During the computational component, we generated a predictive model which more 
than doubled the speed of generating appropriate energy landscapes for spectral hole burning 
simulations for realistic values of md2
. We learned that an increase in md2
decreases the 
spacing of the energy bands, and increasing the standard deviation of the wells increases the 
spacing of energy levels within the same band. We developed a Markov chain Monte-Carlo 
single molecule spectroscopy algorithm and implemented it into the larger program. We 
observed several instances where the pigment molecules can oscillate between two wells very 
quickly. This is a result of randomly generating landscapes where sometimes adjacent wells 
with similar energy levels and low barriers are generated which creates exceptionally high 
tunneling rates.
By comparing our histogram to the LH2 experimental results of Köhler’s group, we 
were able to make a prediction of md2 =1.34*10-26 kg nm2
. This matches well with values 
obtained for several other complexes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>retail food access divide, warehouse clubs, on-premises services, e-commerce services</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This study explores consumer access to warehouse clubs in regions characterized by a pronounced retail food access divide, specifically where there is a high ratio of convenience stores to supermarkets and grocery stores. Despite the cost-efficiency and broad product offerings of warehouse clubs, their limited store network and membership fees raise questions about their capacity to attract consumers in areas with substantial gaps in food access. This research focuses on three key aspects: the direct effect of the food access divide on consumer visits to warehouse clubs, the influence of on-premises services on this relationship, and the influence of e-commerce services on this relationship. The results reveal that a high ratio of convenience stores to supermarkets and grocery stores significantly reduces consumer foot traffic to warehouse clubs. However, on-premises services, especially healthcare, not only boost consumer visits to warehouse clubs but also mitigate the negative impact of limited access to healthy food options on these visits. Automotive services also contribute positively, albeit to a lesser extent. E-commerce services have a nuanced role: while both home delivery and omni-pickup options decrease foot traffic directly, delivery services moderate the negative impacts of a high retail food access divide by sustaining consumer foot traffic. Conversely, omni-pickup services exacerbate the negative effects by further reducing in-person visits. This research enriches the literature on the retail food access divide, spatial resilience of warehouse clubs, and retailers’ channel capabilities. By integrating on-premises and e-commerce services, warehouse clubs can enhance retail service equity across diverse regions, particularly improving consumer accessibility in areas with significant retail food disparities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Fallouh, Yolla</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Brand love is an emotional relationship established between consumers and their preferred brands. Its various positive consequences, including loyalty, paying price premiums, and positive word-of-mouth, have been leveraged in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. Regardless of its great potential in optimizing patient journeys, it has not yet been leveraged in the prescription drug industry. This research aims to enhance patients’ long-term involvement with branded drugs by extending brand love into the pharmaceutical industry. A two-step mixed methodology study was utilized to explore the phenomenon. Study I qualitatively analyzed patients’ reviews from social media platforms using the content analysis software Voyant Tools and provided a general understanding of patients’ overall emotions toward their prescription drugs. Study II quantitively confirmed the main dimensions of the phenomenon through a survey (N=363) and using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The qualitative results confirmed the presence of prescription drug brand love and explored its main variables, while the quantitative survey identified three main dimensions characterizing prescription drug brand love: trust, information-exchange, and accessibility. Additionally, Study II yielded 11 validated items describing the phenomenon. The findings equip industry professionals with significant insights aiming to optimize branded medication’s marketing strategies. This research offers a preliminary understanding of the phenomenon and identifies its general topology, leaving immense opportunities for future researchers to expand upon.

        <etd_ms:title>Free-Energy Based Modeling of Planar Dielectric Elastomer Actuators</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fan, Jingyu</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) have gained increasing attention over the last decades and have been widely developed for applications fields such as robots, aerospace, biomedicine due to the fast response, high energy density, light weight, and low cost. However, the task of modeling of DEAs is typically challenged in the presence of the nonlinear features, time-independent viscoelastic behaviors, complex electromechanical coupling, etc.
To address such a challenge, a free-energy based model for DEAs moving in vertical direction is proposed, in an effort to investigate the physical properties of DEAs in this research. The developed model is based on the principle of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, where the Gent model and generalized Maxwell model are applied to describe the free energy and viscoelastic behavior of DEA, respectively. Unlike the existing modeling methods, this research narrows the focus on the inertial force and viscoelasticity which leads to DEA’s instability.
After that, the free-energy based model is simulated in MATLAB and the several sets of experiments are implemented by setting various driving voltage amplitudes and frequencies. According to the experimental data, the undetermined parameters of the model are identified by using differential evolutionary algorithm. The comparison of the model simulation and experimental results supports the validation of the proposed free-energy based model.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Farazmand, Siavash</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, this thesis illustrates how public transportation can be optimized in line with smart city visions. Deep learning models can be used to analyze complex datasets in order to predict demand, streamline operations, and adapt dynamically to real-time conditions. The research focuses on two key components: first, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with probabilistic node embeddings is used to predict passenger flow in bus networks, improving accuracy and optimizing resource allocation. This method is validated using Automated Passenger Counting (APC) data from Laval, Quebec. The second component employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to enhance ride-matching and vehicle routing in on-demand shared mobility services, particularly addressing the first-mile problem in suburban areas. Sensitivity analyses confirm the adaptability and effectiveness of both approaches, showcasing the potential of AI to improve transportation efficiency in diverse urban and suburban contexts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Coatings - Graphene Oxide - Friction - Wear- Photocuring - Liquid Crystals</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis presents an exploration of advanced tribological coatings for improving wear resistance and reducing friction in mechanical components, particularly in industries like aerospace. Traditional coating methods such as physical vapor deposition and high-velocity oxygen fuel have limitations, necessitating innovative approaches. This research introduces the use of graphene oxide liquid crystals combined with photocuring to develop coatings that significantly enhance tribological performance. The liquid crystal self-assembly of graphene oxide in alcohol allows for dense ordering of platelets on substrates, and photocuring creates strong, covalent bonds between the platelets and the substrate, resulting in durable coatings. 
Experimental results demonstrated a remarkable reduction of up to 72% in the friction coefficient compared to uncoated substrates. The study also explored the effects of annealing on coating performance, finding that annealed coatings exhibited lower friction and superior wear resistance for low graphene oxide contents. The research underscores the potential of photocured graphene oxide coatings to address the tribological challenges in critical applications, offering a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable solution that advances the field of coating materials science and engineering.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis proposes a novel approach to enhance road safety by integrating historical vehicle crash data with the International Road Assessment Program (iRAP) road protection scores. The primary objective is to identify high-risk locations and prioritize remedial works effectively.
The research involves two key tasks: first, employing hotspot analysis to pinpoint significant locations based on road protection deficiencies and accident density per type of crash; second, using a rule set to identify road segments that should receive remedial works by comparing the crashes on the map based on injury-severity itself (fatal, minor, serious) with star rating score in iRAP data for different users (pedestrian, vehicles, cyclist, motorcyclist) for per type of crash. iRAP’s Star Rating Scores (SRS) quantify the relative risk to road users, providing a basis for identifying priority road sections and comparing performance over time.
The methodology integrates iRAP assessments with historical crash data to produce a spatial safety analysis, highlighting areas with a high frequency of severe accidents and road deficiencies. This combined approach allows for more comprehensive identification of risk locations, guiding the deployment of targeted remedial works
The results demonstrate that integrating iRAP scores with crash data provides a clearer identification of hazardous locations, supporting more informed decision-making for road safety improvements. The findings suggest that prioritizing remedial works at locations with high crash rates and low iRAP scores can significantly enhance road safety.
In conclusion, this thesis contributes to the field of road safety management by presenting a robust method for combining historical crash data with iRAP assessments. The proposed approach not only identifies high-risk areas but also prioritizes them for remedial actions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Fereidouni, Mahmoud</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The in-situ consolidation of thermoplastic composites (TPCs) via automated fiber placement (AFP) represents a promising method for manufacturing advanced high-performance structures, utilizing the distinct advantages of thermoplastics and enabling out-of-autoclave production. However, the widespread adoption of this method is impeded by various, poorly understood defects that can undermine structural integrity. This thesis begins by systematically identifying and characterizing these defects, providing a foundation for future research on their potential impact on mechanical performance. Subsequently, a novel experimental technique is introduced to monitor the temperature of incoming tape during in-situ consolidation, which is the most critical parameter controlling defect development. This is followed by an in-depth theoretical and experimental analysis of the transverse deformation of incoming tape under the compaction roller, a phenomenon that controls the size of gaps and overlaps as key defects in AFP-manufactured composite parts. The insights from this work can deepen the understanding of how specific process and material parameters directly influence the final tape width, paving the way for developing practical strategies to optimize AFP processes to manufacture higher-quality thermoplastic composites free of gaps or overlaps, and minimized dependent defects, e.g. fiber/ply waviness.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Filler, Tzvi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The gardening industry is a multi-billion-dollar enterprise, and currently lacks an autonomous system for removing weeds from an arbitrary garden. The Mobile Weed Remover (MWR) project in the Advanced Mechatronics and Robotics Lab at Concordia seeks to fill this void.
In this thesis, a great amount of re-design work has been carried out to improve the design of both mechanical and electrical systems of the second generation of MWR to make it functional. The mathematical models of MWR are built including the “ideal modeling” and “discrete modeling”. The simulation of the built models is carried out in Matlab/Simulink to investigate the dynamics of the robot. The control algorithm is designed including forward-backward position correction and error direction and handling. The designed controller is integrated with improved MWR robots and the real time control system is implemented in the on-board computer of the robots. The designed robot uses a camera in order to identify, seek out, and destroy weeds, which enables it to operate in an arbitrary garden. In order to target the roots of the weed, the MWR requires a positioning system that can guide the rover to the desired position, which should be able to take the cues from the visual system. The research in this thesis seeks to adapt a control algorithm to the MWR and enable it to approach a target. 
Simulation was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the developed control algorithm. A simple mono-chrome target was used to represent the dandelion in the real time control tests. The experimental results further verify that the control system was operational and deliver satisfactory results.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Detection and Identification of Covert and Replay Attacks
in Cyber-physical Systems Using Model-Based and
Data-Driven Based Methods</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have revolutionized various domains, including smart grids, manufacturing, transportation systems, and autonomous vehicles such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While CPS configurations offer numerous advantages, they are particularly vulnerable to stealthy cyber-attacks due to their specific structure, in which the command and control center is far from the plant and operation side, making security a critical concern. Among these attacks, covert and replay attacks pose significant challenges for detection, particularly in UAV applications. This research focuses on detecting such stealthy attacks using two approaches: a model-based scenario where the mathematical model of the system is available and a data-driven scenario where only data is accessible, making it more practical for high-fidelity systems.
In the model-based approach, the research develops a coding design to enhance the detection functionality and expand its scope to meet security requirements. This framework strengthens the system’s ability to counter stealthy attacks effectively. On the other hand, for scenarios where only data is available and inherently vulnerable to cyber-attacks, an effective algorithm is designed
to detect and identify covert and replay attacks by assigning appropriate labels. This algorithm leverages neural network (NN) models for training and evaluation, ensuring high accuracy and
proficiency in attack detection.
To optimize computational efficiency, the algorithm employs feature selection techniques during the data preprocessing stage, minimizing the reliance on complex NN models. This not only
reduces computational resource consumption but also enhances the accuracy of the detection model. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies is validated through simulations on a 6-degree-of-freedom quadrotor, a critical application highly susceptible to cyber-attacks. The results demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the contributions in detecting and mitigating stealthy cyberattacks in CPS configurations.
This research provides a framework for improving the security of CPSs in both model-based and data-driven scenarios, contributing to safer and more resilient systems in critical applications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Towards Spatiotemporal Resolution of Copper Aspartate in Gel</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Chiral resolution is essential in the pharmaceutical and food industries, as well as in material engineering, due to the unique properties of enantiomers. This study explores the coordination polymerization of homochiral (L- and D-) and racemic (DL-) copper aspartate (CuAsp) and spatiotemporal resolution of racemic aspartic acid (DL-Asp) using L- and D-proline (Pro)-copper complexes as tailor-made additives (TMAs) via reaction-diffusion frameworks (RDFs) in both 1D and 2D agar gel systems. The imposed supersaturation gradient translates into a gradient of crystal sizes facilitating the formation of CuAsp coordination polymers with spherulitic morphology. Solid-state circular dichroism (CD) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses confirmed the chiral nature and crystalline phases of the CuAsp polymers, with DL-CuAsp forming as conglomerates. Drawing inspiration from Kaoru Harada’s seminal work on the resolution of DL-Asp using L- and D-Pro-copper complexes, the preferential crystallization with ‘rule of reversal’ was evident, where the crystalline CuAsp near the liquid-gel interface exhibited the opposite configuration to those of the TMA. Variability in chirality was noted further from the interface due to concentration gradients. These findings underscore the utility of RDF coupled with the rule of reversal in chiral resolutions, offering an effective strategy for enhancing enantioselectivity in racemic compounds across various applications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Fox, Sicily Piper Burnett</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In recent years several Canadian Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (ENGOs) have publicly declared their commitment to conservation partnerships with Indigenous Nations and communities. However, a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities they experience is lacking. The current research project investigated how these partnerships contribute to advancing conservation projects, including Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (IPCAs). A review of literature underscored the importance of such partnerships, however the mechanisms to establish and maintain these relationships have received limited attention. To address this gap, a pilot survey of 5 national ENGOs was conducted, followed by semi structured interviews of representatives from 24 ENGOs and one Indigenous educational non-profit organization focused on conservation. Using the framework developed by Stein, Ahenakew, and Kui (2023), ENGO efforts to transform and decolonize conventional conservation approaches were categorized into four non-linear, non exclusive stages: representation, recognition, redistribution, and reparation. The responses most often fell within the “recognition” category, while the “representation” and “redistribution” categories were less frequently addressed. Notably, no responses fit well within the “reparation” category, highlighting a need for a more fundamental shift in how conservation is practiced. While ENGOs cannot achieve this transformation alone, the findings of this study indicate that ENGOs occupy a unique position in the sector which they should leverage to challenge colonial approaches and drive positive change.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The Province of Quebec has a staggering high school dropout rate of 19% for boys and 12% for girls. Often, efforts to help these young people are mostly focused on remedial school work. As such, they fail to fully address some key psychological elements of adolescence and early adulthood. For this project, I therefore decided to look at the problem by considering adolescence as a transitional or liminal phase from youth to adulthood, one necessitating special recognition by the larger community. I also considered the adolescent brain's propensity for risk-taking and its desire for heroic stories as means to discover the world during this liminal period. This led me to look to rites of passage, play, theatre and the aesthetic of the carnivalesque as means to create humorous, and symbol-laden ways for the youth to engage with the world. 
The research took the form of eight (8) day-long sessions, structured like a rite of passage, focusing on rituals that were co-designed with a group of high school dropouts attending a youth center in Trois-Rivières. We used Future Workshops Participatory Design principles and Augusto Boal’s Games for Actors and Non-Actors as means to encourage free and authentic contributions from the participants. The work was at times filmed in order to provide participants with a method for self-analysis crucial in their ritual design. Beyond increasing participants’ self-esteem and sense of belonging, this project provides educational designers with new play-based ideas for engaging youth as well as a carnivalesque approach for participatory design.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effect of Early Bilingualism on Executive Functions: A Training Study with the Early Executive Functions Questionnaire</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fratino, Victoria</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The bilingual cognitive advantage states that bilinguals exhibit greater executive function (EF) abilities than monolinguals. This advantage has been reported in children as young as 6 months old yet has failed to be consistently replicated. Given that the bulk of the literature has used correlational designs, the present study adopted a training design which aimed to determine whether teaching monolingual children a second language will lead to greater increases in EF than if taught words in their native language. Two groups of children completed a 12-week online training program during which 9 translation equivalents (TEs; experimental condition) or 9 novel words in their native language (control condition) were taught weekly. Participants’ EF was compared pre- and post-intervention using the Early Executive Functions Questionnaire, which assesses working memory (WM), flexibility (FX), inhibitory control (IC), regulation, and cognitive executive function (CEF, which is a factor that loads onto WM, FX, and IC). Word learning was assessed weekly with a forced choice task based on pointing or touch. Results suggest that learning TEs is more difficult than learning new words in one’s native vocabulary. Results also indicate that although the total sample significantly increased in IC, FX, WM, and CEF from pre- to post-intervention there was no time by condition interaction indicating that the groups EF skills grew equivalently. Finally, only learning TEs was associated with improvement in working memory. To conclude, our results do not support a bilingual advantage at 25 months but suggest a link between second language acquisition and WM.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>How effective have national parks in Canada been since their designation at preventing landscape fragmentation?</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Landscape connectivity has become an important focus of Canada’s conservation goals. However, ongoing habitat loss and the break-up of habitat patches change a landscape’s composition and configuration, creating additional barriers for wildlife movement and reducing its connectivity. Canadian national parks are at risk of becoming fragmented from direct and indirect stressors, and of becoming islands of natural habitat that are disconnected from their surrounding ecosystems. This study measured the landscape fragmentation of 43 Canadian national parks and paired control areas at key time-steps throughout their history, including before their designation to present-day. It also studied the divergence of fragmentation levels over time between the parks and their control areas. The Effective Mesh Size metric (meff) with both the CUT and CBC procedures was used to measure fragmentation levels, alongside a Progressive-Change Before-After Control-Impact Paired Series study design. The results demonstrate that overall, park protection across the Canadian National Park System has been somewhat successful in preventing landscape fragmentation within their boundaries, in comparison to unprotected control areas. Half of the parks and control areas had a very small change in fragmentation over time. In 35% of parks, fragmentation levels increased faster than in their control areas, and in 15% of parks, fragmentation levels increased more slowly than in their control areas. Older parks with a long history of human influence on the landscape are more fragmented than their control areas, whereas parks that have been designated more recently have a greater effective mesh size than their associated control areas. The regions with the most successful parks in terms of preventing fragmentation are the Taiga and Hudson. The variety of park sizes in these regions indicates that the size of a national park does not necessarily indicate its fragmentation levels. This study provides insights into trends of landscape fragmentation over a long time-period and relates them to different Parks Canada management strategies throughout the agency’s history. The findings will help inform ecological connectivity programming and can indicate the effectiveness of Canada’s efforts to achieve its conservation goals.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Reappraising Beliefs About Losing Control: An Experimental Investigation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fridgen, Cailyn P.E.A.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Background and Objectives: Beliefs about losing control over one’s thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and/or bodily functions have been shown to cause obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The cognitive model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suggests that catastrophic misappraisals of intrusions will lessen if underlying maladaptive beliefs are effectively reduced. 
The primary aim of this study was to experimentally investigate whether preexisting appraisals about losing control could be reduced by reappraising a previous perceived loss of control. 
Methods: A sample of (n = 52) undergraduate participants underwent either a brief cognitive intervention or a control memory task. Appraisals about losing control and anxiety were measured before and after the manipulation.
Results: In comparison to participants in the control condition, participants in the experimental condition reported a significantly greater reduction in appraisals about having lost control (F(1, 50) = 10.79, p = .002, ηp2 = .18) and about losing control in the future (F(1, 50) = 7.82, p = .007, ηp2 = .14) but not anxiety F(1, 50) = .81, p = .37, ηp2 = .02). 
Limitations: The absence of an impact on anxiety may be attributed to an underpowered sample size or the lack of a more robust intervention.
Conclusions: Results suggest that pre-existing beliefs about losing control can be reduced via a brief cognitive reappraisal-based intervention. Findings are discussed with respect to clinical and 
phenomenological implications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Burnout among art teachers has become a significant concern, marked by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment. This thesis explores innovative strategies to prevent burnout and rekindle passion for art among educators by integrating heuristics, poetry, photography, and mindfulness into their daily practices. Utilizing a heuristic methodology, the study emphasizes self-inquiry and discovery, offering art educators a structured yet flexible approach to navigate professional challenges. The research draws on Julia Cameron's principles from The Artist's Way and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of "flow" to foster creative resilience and optimal engagement. Additionally, it incorporates insights from Jon Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Ellen Langer's mindful learning framework to enhance emotional regulation and well-being. Through a studio-based approach, this study documents the experiences of the researcher-participant, highlighting effective methods for integrating small artistic habits and mindfulness practices into daily routines. The findings aim to provide actionable strategies for sustaining artistic engagement and well-being, ultimately contributing to the discourse on teacher retention and the development of supportive educational environments.

        <etd_ms:title>Asking the “Overwhelming Question”: Or, Why Do Poets Fail at Difficult Conversations?</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fyfe, Frances Grace</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>difficult conversations, modernist poetry, literary criticism, T. S. Eliot</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>T. S. Eliot’s declaration that “poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be difficult” owes something to the experience of art the poet championed, one in which anxiety around poetry’s difficulty would be transformed into an “authentic” relationship between reader and text. This thesis argues Eliot’s pronouncement that poets should enact a difficulty of the most authentic order really means that poets should try to enact poems in the model of dynamic, informal speech between reader and text—something for which we might use “conversation” as a shorthand. At the same time, I also consider the way conversation is always a problem for poets, at least those working in the proto-professional literary landscape in which Eliot was invested, a time when critics were developing strict methods to judge poetry based on its properties rather than its effects. This is not just because the proto-professional poet’s formal expertise comes at the expense of their ability to engage in informal, affective speech, but also because to authentically represent such speech means to fail to do so, since success in conversation means ceding formal authority in favour of spontaneity itself. In linking developments in modern literary criticism to extraliterary forms of communication difficulty, I argue our contemporary obsession with difficult conversations speaks as much to a desire for “authentic relationships” as it does to an anxiety around the increasing professionalization of artmaking in industrial modernity, and the kinds of interpersonal communication it seems to foreclose.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Adaptive Priors in Probabilistic Topic Models for Bursty Discovery in Textual Data</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In the field of natural language processing, topic modeling plays an important role in detecting latent topics in large amounts of text. Models that use traditional methods of representation, however, often fail to capture the 'burstiness' characteristic of natural language - the tendency for previously occurring words to recur within the same document. In order to address this limitation, we introduce two innovative topic modeling frameworks: the Generalized Dirichlet Compound Multinomial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (GDCMLDA) and the Beta-Liouville Dirichlet Compound Multinomial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (BLDCMLDA). Using Dirichlet Compound Multinomial distribution together with Generalized Dirichlet and Beta-Liouville distributions, both frameworks integrate advanced distribution methods. By integrating these concepts, it is possible to model the burstiness phenomenon while maintaining a variety of topic proportion patterns that can be varied and flexible. As a result of our comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark text datasets, we conclude that GDCMLDA and BLDCMLDA are superior to existing models. The evidence for this is found in the improved performance metrics, including the scores for perplexity and coherence. Our results confirm that the proposed models are able to capture the complexities of word usage dynamics, thus contributing to a significant advancement in topic modeling.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Garaye, Jaspreet Singh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Circular Economy, Blockchain, Digital Goods, Case Study Analysis, Supply Chain for Digital Goods, Sustainability, 5R framework (extended).</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the integration of blockchain technology within the digital goods sector, with a focus on enhancing sustainability through the 7R framework—Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repair, Recover, Regenerate, and Rethink. By embedding these principles into the digital goods supply chain, this research addresses the pressing challenges of resource efficiency, waste reduction, and lifecycle management in the evolving digital economy.

The study begins with an extensive literature review, examining existing work on blockchain, circular economy, and digital goods supply chains, highlighting key gaps and opportunities. Based on these insights, the thesis proposes an extension of the traditional 5R framework, evolving it into the 7R model to better suit the digital goods landscape. This framework is then applied to two detailed case studies: Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Services and Nike’s CryptoKicks project. These cases demonstrate how blockchain can enhance transparency, traceability, and operational efficiency while aligning with circular economy principles.

The research presents a comprehensive analysis of how blockchain technology supports each aspect of the 7R framework, enabling digital goods to be tracked, reused, recycled, and regenerated efficiently. The case studies illustrate the potential for blockchain to overcome key challenges such as digital piracy, counterfeiting, and inefficient resource management. Through blockchain's ability to secure ownership transfer and monitor digital goods' lifecycles, the thesis highlights blockchain’s role in reducing waste and extending the lifecycle of digital products.

The findings contribute to academic and practical fields, offering a new theoretical framework for the sustainable management of digital goods. This research also provides actionable insights for businesses and policymakers, showing how blockchain and the 7R framework can foster innovation in digital goods consumption and production, driving the sector towards more sustainable practices. The results underscore the transformative potential of blockchain in reshaping the digital goods supply chain to support environmental and economic sustainability.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper will seek to examine as to how Mantab, a frozen fruit and vegetable importer based in Eastern Canada overcame the challenges brought upon by the Covid-19 pandemic. This case study will identify Mantab’s identification, prevention, and mitigation strategies to each risk the organization is exposed to both internally and externally. Additionally, an in-depth investigation into Mantab’s financial health will be conducted and how it contributed to the decision-making processes made during the pandemic. Lastly, an investigation into the company’s risk tolerance and risk appetite level will be analyzed and determining whether they are in fact justifiable. The purpose of this study is to understand which decisions resulted in a positive or negative outcome and if they led to the organization gaining or losing market share. In retrospect, this will enable the organization to strengthen their overall operational resiliency and provide better insight on how to navigate through future turbulent working environments.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Identity and Sense of Belonging in Second-Generation Immigrants of Montréal</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gendron, Annabelle</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis presents a multilayered qualitative analysis of the identity and sense of belonging of second-generation immigrants in Montréal. Through a methodology consisting of individual interviews and focus groups, this research explores the everyday experiences of second- generation immigrants as they navigate various social relationships and negotiate colliding cultural environments. The conceptualization of second-generation immigration poses as an interesting theoretical issue for the understanding of different experiences of migration. Analyses of intergenerational relationships suggest that family members greatly influence second- generation immigrants’ identity and sense of belonging through multiple processes of socialization. Furthermore, within the context of this province, language is revealed as a meaningful feature of these individuals’ lives, as they navigate several language policies and different facets of the Québécois society. Lastly, the communities surrounding second-generation immigrants are immensely informative as to the construction and the evolution of sense of belonging. As second-generation immigrants recall being asked "Where are you from?", the strategies they mobilize to cultivate inclusion into different communities are telling about the discrimination that they experience. Second-generation immigrants show that they strongly connect to the Montrealer identity and sense of belonging, attachments that are stimulated by the presence of ethnic and cultural diversity in the city. Through the above-mentioned concepts, this thesis shows that identity and sense of belonging are hybrid, fluid and multiple, as they are continuously constructed and evolving alongside everyday interactions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Early Detection of Emerging Technologies Using Machine Learning and Burst Detection</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ghaemmaghami, Ali</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Certainly, the impact of emerging technologies is changing our world and how we live, shaping our future significantly. In the constantly evolving landscape of these technologies, which attracts substantial yearly investments, spotting these trends early on is both challenging and expensive. However, applying an emerging technology detection method in an effective and efficient way is considered a challenging task for many stakeholders. In this thesis, we address these problems through applying a method to predict potential emerging technologies in the case study field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using this method may help policymakers to identify potential emerging technologies early in a more systematic way with little manual intervention. In the proposed method, using burst detection, machine learning, and deep learning, we attempt to predict the future sustaining emerging technologies. We applied the methodology by four methods, namely Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Results showed that the method was successful in its tasks. The method had the Area under the Curve (AUC) rate of more than 75% to accurately predict the sustainability of the potential emerging technologies. More specifically, applying the MLP method showed the ability to increase the AUC rate and recall metric as the most important metrics of our work. In summary, this approach carries both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, the exploration of novel combinations, such as integrating deep learning and burst detection methods or employing transformers, offers researchers fresh insights into the challenge of detecting emergence. On the practical front, the application of methods providing high accuracy rates in machine learning methods empowers stakeholders to implement these methods effectively in practical scenarios.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Failure and Reliability Analysis of Composite Pipes for Oil and Gas Drilling Applications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ghani, Ehsan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Composite pipes are increasingly replacing traditional materials like steel in various industries due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. This is particularly beneficial for the oil industry, especially in drilling applications where structures face multi-axial loadings.
However, the anisotropic mechanical behavior of these materials adds complexity to their analysis. Moreover, their mechanical properties are statistically variable, affecting component response and failure.
To address these challenges, mathematical models are employed to analyze composite pipe performance, and statistical methods are used to assess their reliability. The primary focus is on developing a composite pipe design capable of withstanding anticipated drilling loads. This involves determining the optimal layup design and
identifying first-ply failure envelopes under combined tension, torsion, and pressure using three-dimensional finite element models in ABAQUS software.
Furthermore, the occurrence of delamination between layers is investigated by integrating the cohesive zone model into simulations. The reliability of composite pipes with suitable layup designs is quantified by considering the statistical variation of
mechanical properties. Reliability-based first-ply failure contours are determined by analyzing the load distribution that each pipe, with specific mechanical properties, could withstand just before damage occurs.
In conclusion, this work aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of composite pipe behavior under drilling conditions. By utilizing advanced modeling techniques and statistical analysis, it seeks to optimize composite pipe designs for enhanced reliability
and performance in the oil industry.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The main objective of the thesis is to effectively detect and isolate faults and detect cyber-attacks and isolate faults from cyber-attacks for UAVs.
In our first result, we leverage SVMs as a supervised machine-learning technique and Kalman filtering as a proven model-based method. We show that these methods can effectively detect and isolate faults and cyber-attacks. This thesis emphasizes the importance of hybrid approaches to fault and cyber-attacks 
SVMs perform equally well for the FDI cyber-attack detection on the control inputs of the ground control system. We propose to train two-class SVM only with the healthy dataset while adding a small bias to control the input of randomly selected observations. To isolate faults from cyber-attacks, we propose to use two Chi-squared, one on the plant side and the other on the controller side that reliably isolates faults from cyber-attacks.
In our second result, we investigate the problem of stealthy caber-attack detection, where the attackers exploit full knowledge of the system to launch undetectable cyber-attacks. We study replay and covert cyber-attacks, and to make them detectable, we use coding techniques.
We extend the two-way coding for MIMO discrete-time systems and study its properties using Kalman filtering for stealthy cyber-attack detection. We show that for an attacker to remove the cyber-attack impact from coded output, it is necessary to know the coding. We propose a new coding scheme using randomly generated numbers on the controller side that effectively converts coded inputs and outputs to time-varying random numbers.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A hybrid NFV/In-Network Computing MANO Architecture for provisioning Holographic Applications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ghasemi Javid, Farzaneh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The emergence of innovative holographic applications, such as holographic concerts, have requirements on network infrastructure such as high bandwidth and ultra-low latency. As demonstrated in recent research, for efficient provisioning of these types of applications, we require a Hybrid Network Function Virtualization (NFV) / IN-Network Computing (INC) network infrastructures. 
    INC, a novel technology, distributes computational workloads across the network by deploying computational tasks on programmable devices like routers and switches. However, integrating INC into existing infrastructure presents significant challenges in terms of life-cycle management and orchestration of network functions and components. The network functions in these hybrid environments consist of two types of components, including VNFs and INCs. While the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) framework enables application provisioning in NFV-enabled networks, it does not provide support for INC-enabled environments. Therefore it is necessary to develop a new MANO architecture capable of provisioning applications that incorporate both VNF and INC components. 
    The main contribution of this thesis is twofold. First, we propose a novel hybrid NFV-INC MANO architecture which is specifically designed for provisioning holographic applications within a hybrid NFV/INC environment. This architecture builds upon the foundation established by the ETSI NFV MANO framework. Second, the proposed architecture is prototyped and measurements are made to evaluate the deployment time of the hybrid Network Services and showing that deploying INC components takes less time than deploying VNFs.
    The essential NFV-INC MANO functional entities, such as INC management module, NFV-INC orchestration, and INC infrastructure manager are identified. In addition, a set of RESTful interfaces is proposed to enable interaction with components.  
    To validate the proposed concept, the prototype is constructed utilizing Open Source MANO (OSM) for orchestration and management network services. Microk8s is employed for container orchestration, automating the deployment of Kubernetes Network Functions (KNFs). Also, the Mininet emulator prepares the programmable switches which serve as the INC infrastructure. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated through comprehensive measurements. Additionally, the architecture is validated by concrete measurements on the deployment latency for five different test cases.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Image Moment-based Visual Servoing for Satellite Target Tracking using a Robotic Manipulator</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ghiasvand, Shayan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Robotic manipulators have become indispensable tools in space operations. Over the past few decades, manipulators like Canadarm2 have played significant roles, ranging from repair tasks to the complex process of capturing servicing satellites. On this basis, the main objective of this research is to automate the satellite-catching process on the International Space Station (ISS). The study employs an image moment-based visual servoing to fulfill the task. Various image features have been introduced to control the manipulator’s movements using image moments. Yet, these features often face the challenging issue of coupling between six degrees of freedom movements, a problem that many researchers have aimed to solve. Nevertheless, previous literature has not completely addressed decoupling, which reveals the need for alternative approaches.
In this research, two novel approaches, function-based visual servoing and deep neural network (DNN)-based visual servoing, were developed to address this challenge. In the first approach, we introduce a novel general image feature function whose numerator and denominator are the polynomials with terms consisting of various image moments and adjustable parameters. Through the optimization process, two distinct rotational features about the x and y axes are formulated with the optimally tuned parameters. The second approach integrates DNN to estimate the 6D pose of the camera, yielding six decoupled image features.
Experimental results from the Denso manipulator confirm that decoupling image features can improve the controlling performance of the manipulator for capturing servicing satellites. The DNN-based visual servoing method could potentially enhance the performance of Canadarm2 in catching satellites, achieving a 32.04% average reduction in pose error and enhancing the velocity’s precision by 21.67% over traditional methods.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Control Systems-Cybersecurity-Cyberphysical systems-Overactuated systems- Dynamic Positioning System</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Over-actuated systems are crucial for advanced control functionalities in various industries, with Dynamic Positioning (DP) systems serving as a prime example. DP systems, commonly found in marine vessels and offshore platforms, maintain fixed positions using multiple thrusters. As Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), DP systems integrate computation, communication, and physical components to achieve control objectives. However, their reliance on communication networks makes them vulnerable to False Data Injection (FDI) cyber-attacks, where adversaries can compromise signals sent from the controller to the thrusters. This thesis presents methods for secure estimation, attack reconstruction, isolation, and compensation within a centralized thrust allocation framework. Key contributions include achieving these goals without relying on strict input-output matrix conditions, and allowing thrusters to remain operational even when affected by FDI attacks. Furthermore, the thesis addresses the challenge of reducing and shifting the attack surface, particularly in over-actuated systems, where numerous communication links increase vulnerability. To mitigate this, the allocation scheme is transformed from a centralized to a decentralized framework. In this approach, control signals are sent to a randomly chosen thruster, periodically switching to prevent successful attacks. Thrusters then coordinate through a consensus network to realize the control commands, while the consensus protocol is resilient under attacks on the communication channels between the thrusters. The decentralized protocol is effective in both closed-loop and open-loop operations. Finally, the estimation and compensation techniques developed earlier in the thesis are also applied to enhance the resilience of the decentralized architecture.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Gicopoulos, Constantina</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis is interested in examining the rhetorical device of textual excess and how its use in Hanya Yanagihara’s 2015 novel A Little Life complicates plausibility, insofar as it concerns the genre of trauma fiction. I will specifically tend to the tension between the aesthetic objectives of A Little Life and how they conflict with the ethics of representation by defining “aesthetic” interests as those invested in the lavish glamours of the book and contrasting them with the aesthetic of suffering which constitutes Jude St. Francis’s being, and consequently bleeds into the rest of the novel. A Little Life is both renown and reviled for its famously distressed protagonist and his continuous misfortunes, such that it has joined the chorus of literature that favors pushing fiction past its textual and moral limits—not only was it published in a climate in which the preoccupation around authorial responsibility persists, but its events take this concern to a nearly unprecedented extreme. The result of this aesthetic marriage is both frustrating and urgent, in that Jude’s textual treatment subverts the reader’s expectations around believability as a spectator to his myriad abuses. Ultimately, even though the novel’s aesthetic choices trigger major morality points concerning the text’s commitment to describing and prescribing pain, the trigger itself is necessary in that it generates critical questions on representation and therefore what is represented is grounds for critiquing the nature and narrative of recovery from physical and psychological trauma.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Frames for measures on Cantor sets</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Girard, René</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this study of frames for measures on Cantor sets, we consider four measures with support contained in a Cantor set. These are the mass distribution measure, the Hausdorff measure of the appropriate dimension restricted to the Cantor set, the unique measure from Hutchinson's theorem for self-similar sets and the unique Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure with respect to the Cantor-Lebesgue function. For the ternary and quaternary Cantor sets, respectively, we show that 
these four measures give the same measure $\mu$. This allows us to study frames in $L^2(\mu)$. 

While the theory of frames is well developed, the literature on frames on Cantor 
sets is recent and limited. Central in defining frames of exponentials on Cantor sets is the set of integers (hereafter called \textit{spectrum}) obtained from the Fourier transform of each measure supported on the corresponding Cantor set. After giving some background on frames, we follow the work of Jorgensen and 
Pedersen (1998) to find the spectrum of the mass distribution measure on the quaternary Cantor set from its Fourier transform and show that we do have an orthonormal basis, which is a special case of a frame. We also present the result of Jorgensen and Pedersen (1998) for the mass distribution measure on the ternary Cantor set, that it is not possible to have a spectrum that yields an orthonormal set of exponentials. However, this leads to the question: can we show the existence of a frame from the spectrum of the mass distribution measure on the ternary Cantor set? Recent work (for example, Lev (2018), Picioroaga and Weber (2017)) study this question but it remains an open problem.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Giridharan, Aiswarya</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Shopping centres, anchor stores, foot traffic, digital divide, internet inequality, socio-economic disparities</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This study investigates how anchor store clusters within shopping centres interact with internet inequality and socio-economic inequality to influence foot traffic. Foot traffic data from over 400 shopping centres owned by Regency Centres spanning 2017 to 2019 are analysed. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the configuration of anchor store clusters. Key findings include: 1) Higher internet inequality correlates with increased foot traffic, suggesting a preference for in-store shopping, while overall socio-economic disadvantages have minimal impact on overall foot traffic. 2) Specific anchor store clusters, such as diverse non-essential, diverse essential, budget-mix, grocery, and home clusters, significantly enhance foot traffic. In contrast, clusters focusing on health and personal care weaken the effect due to their narrow-range nature. 3) Internet inequality and anchor store types create complex behaviour patterns, with increased reliance on diverse hardline, essential goods, budget-mix, and grocery and home improvement clusters in areas with limited internet access. 4) Some anchor store clusters are significantly beneficial for socio-economically disadvantaged populations facing internet access challenges, emphasizing the value of accessing a broad range of goods in one location, particularly in diverse non-essential and essential general merchandise stores, along with budget-mix and healthcare-oriented stores. These findings suggest that strategic anchor store placement as a means to mitigate the impacts of digital disparities and enhance shopping centre performance, underscoring the importance of inclusive retail environments.

        <etd_ms:description>I didn’t know I had ADHD until I downloaded TikTok. As it happens, neither did thousands of other people, specifically girls and women. Some undiagnosed users report being shown algorithmically curated ADHD-related content on TikTok which propelled them to seek their own diagnoses. Drawing on platform studies and disability studies, this thesis employs the persona studies research method (Bounegru et al., 2022), walkthrough method (Light et al., 2018), and thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2021) to provide insight into how TikTok’s algorithmic content curation and platform affordances foster and affect communities who unite over themes of ADHD. It finds that TikTok's algorithmic interpellation plays an influential role in identity formation and fostering networked publics around ADHD. It identifies key topics and themes prevalent in ADHD-related TikToks, illustrating the influence of the algorithm and medical authority in representations of ADHD on the platform. Overall, this thesis provides a nuanced understanding of TikTok’s ADHD publics, adding to the growing corpus of literature about identity formation and disability publics on algorithmic social media.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Deep learning models excel when tested on images within their training distribution. However, introducing minor perturbations like noise or blurring to the model’s input image and presenting it with out-of-distribution (OOD) data can significantly reduce accuracy, limiting real-world appli- cability. While data augmentation enhances model robustness against OOD data, there is a gap in comprehensive studies on augmentation types and their impact on OOD robustness.
A common belief suggests that augmenting datasets to bias models towards shape-based fea- tures improves OOD robustness for convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet. However, our evaluation of 39 augmentations challenges this belief, showing that an augmentation-induced in- crease in shape bias does not necessarily correlate with higher OOD robustness. Analyzing results, we identify biases in ImageNet that can be mitigated through appropriate augmentation. Contrary to expectations, our evaluation reveals no inherent trade-off between in-domain accuracy and OOD robustness. Strategic augmentation choices can simultaneously enhance both.
Model performance is influenced not only by perturbations but also by the image compression format. Efficient algorithms for image compression play a crucial role in managing costs associ- ated with data storage. We propose an innovative region-based lossy image compression method named PatchSVD, leveraging the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that PatchSVD surpasses SVD-based image compression across three common image compression metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of compression arti- facts between PatchSVD, JPEG, and SVD-based compression, revealing scenarios where PatchSVD artifacts are preferable over both JPEG and SVD artifacts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Investigating voice abnormalities as potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders may
present a cost-effective substitute for other neuro imaging techniques, bringing fresh perspectives
and enhancing diagnostic precision. The objective of this research was to pinpoint voice biomarkers
that can differentiate between healthy individuals and those suffering from dementia, as well as to
create a predictive model for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Our analysis involved
studying voice recordings from 172 French speakers, who were divided into dementia, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), and healthy control (HC) groups. By utilizing Praat and Matlab, we were able to
extract para-linguistic and linguistic speech features. Through various statistical analyses, including
ANCOVA, partial correlations, and stepwise linear regression, we were able to identify discourse
complexity, noun ratio, and average syllables per word as significant predictors of MMSE scores. Our
model, which incorporated these features, outperformed a baseline model that included covariates
such as sex, age, and education level. This demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with an RMSE
of 3.65 and 3.7, and an R-squared of 0.35 and 0.31 on the training and test sets, respectively. This
study underscores the potential of linguistic speech features in the detection of cognitive impairment,
and emphasizes the importance of considering gender separately in the analysis to avoid bias and the
type of vocal task used in data collection.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The construction industry generates over a third of global waste, most of which is produced at the End-of-Life (EoL) stage of built facilities and disposed of in landfills. Existing decision-making models often focus on a limited range of EoL decisions and lack stakeholder diversity, leading to biased outcomes. This study develops an inclusive decision-making model for the EoL stage. It defines a framework of four EoL sub-phases, related decision problems, and alternatives based on a systematic literature review. A set of 25 criteria was compiled, validated through interviews with 25 stakeholders, and weighted using an Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) survey with 52 participants. The model was tested on a two-story, 59,360 SF resort facility in Ontario using data from reports, government sources, quantitative tools, and industry partners. Four scenarios were analyzed: Full Deconstruction, Partial Deconstruction, Full Demolition with landfill disposal, and Full Demolition with recycling. Full Deconstruction emerged as the optimal solution, outperforming Full Demolition with landfill disposal by ~40%. Regulations were identified as the most critical factor, followed by Environmental aspects, ranking higher than Economics—contrary to prior studies. These findings highlight the vital role of government regulations in driving sustainable practices. The resulting model provides robust guidance for decision-makers, addressing EoL complexities and promoting sustainability and circularity in the construction industry.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The multidisciplinary nature of aerospace processes demands coordination across diverse functions, each contributing to the design, development, sustainment, and compliance of highly regulated aerospace products. These processes involve various interconnected and interdependent elements that influence execution, making it challenging to fully deconstruct and reveal the underlying complexities and interactions that shape the overall process.
This thesis explores a practical adaptation of a process mapping technique within the aerospace industry, focusing on a single case study at a Canadian aircraft maintenance company. Through this case study, the thesis illustrates how multiple process mapping approaches can offer different perspectives and enhance process transparency. A current-state manufacturing process is mapped at five different levels of detail: Level 1 provides a high-level overview of the process with milestones and principal tasks; Level 2 incorporates information flow through artifact types; Level 3 adds the roles and expertise required for each activity in the process; Level 4 introduces communication activities; and Level 5 details the working time for each activity.
By analyzing the results from each mapping level, the study evaluates the usability and benefits of incorporating different process elements. The findings show that process mapping is not only suitable for visualizing task-specific workflow but can be customized to meet other end-user needs. It was found that no single level of detail is entirely self-sufficient, and that combining elements such as information flow, roles, communication and time provides distinct perspectives offering value across a wide range of use cases and objectives.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Performance Enhanced 1-bit Bandpass Sturdy-MASH Delta-Sigma Modulator for Radio-over-Fiber Fronthaul Transmission Systems</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gou, Jianzhao</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Fronthual, 1-bit Delta Sigma Modulation, Radio over Fiber System</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Currently, in fronthaul transmission systems of radio access network (RAN), the digitized common public radio interface (CPRI) are being widely used. However, with the development of 5G technology, there are higher demands on signal bandwidth, transmission rate, energy consumption, and other aspects in the fronthaul system. Due to its limited spectrum utilization, high complexity, and large power consumption of the remote radio head (RRH), the digitized CPRI is difficult to satisfy the new requirements of 5G for fronthaul. As an efficient and concise modulation scheme, delta sigma modulator (DSM) can replace multi-bit analog to digital converters (ADCs) with the passive filters at the receiver side of the fronthaul, significantly reducing the complexity of RRHs while meeting the requirements for transmission rate and efficiency. Therefore, DSM has received widespread attention in recent years, and there have been significant developments in new technologies and various structures related to DSM.
In this thesis, an in-depth analysis and comparison of several different structures of 1-bit DSMs are conducted, and an enhanced 1-bit sturdy multi-stage noise-shaping (SMASH) structure for digital fronthaul systems is proposed. The proposed SMASH DSM is based on the traditional SMASH structure, with some structural changes and simplifications made to enhance the modulator's noise shaping capability. In the thesis, a 100-MHz bandwidth 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is used as a digital baseband signal and then modulated onto RF carriers with a center frequency of 2.5 GHz. Finally, the bandpass 1-bit DSM modulation is performed. The process is simulated and experimentally verified.
The detailed comparison among the traditional single-stage delta-sigma modulator (SDSM), the traditional MASH and SMASH, and the proposed SMASH is presented in the fronthaul transmission system. The OFDM signal at radio frequency (RF) is quantized to two bits by SDSM/MASH/SMASH ADC, and this digitized signal is transmitted over 20-km single mode fiber (SMF) in a 2-level amplitude non-return-to-zero (NRZ) or 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) intensity modulation direct detection (IM-DD) system. 
Firstly, it is found that the proposed SMASH DSM has the widest input dynamic range (DR), which means it has better stability, followed by traditional SMASH and MASH, while SDSM performs the worst in terms of input DR. 
Then, in the case of fiber transmission systems, the proposed SMASH has better noise suppression performance than the traditional MASH and SMASH schemes.  In the directly received system, also known as the electric back-to-back (EBTB) system, the error vector magnitude (EVM) of the proposed SMASH, traditional MASH, and SMASH are -32.56 dB, -29.03 dB, and -29.31 dB, respectively. The proposed one has an around 3.2 dB EVM improvement. And in the IM-DD fiber transmission over 20-km SMF, the EVM are -24.71 dB, -23.93 dB, and -22.36 dB, respectively. The proposed scheme also has an around 2.4 dB EVM improvement compared to the traditional SMASH. 
Finally, the comparison result of the two SMASH DSMs is verified in the experiment. In the case of EBTB and optical back-to-back (OBTB) systems, the proposed SMASH has an over 3 dB EVM improvement compared with the traditional SMASH. And in the case of the fiber link, the EVM for proposed SMASH is increased by 2.76 dB and 2.94 dB compared to the traditional one over the 8 km and 20 km fiber, respectively.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Queer Becomings: Deleuze and Guattari’s Critique of Static Identity Categories</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Graves, Nelson A.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this paper I argue that trans exclusionary action from cis lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) political pundits is generated and sustained by a need for recognition by the capturing apparatus of the state, thereby conserving heterosexual familial structures and enforcing a need to identify deviant behavior. Anti-trans activists—including those who are often seen as part of the queer community—increasingly find efforts to affirm trans individuals to be a threat to static notions of gender and identity, which, as these anti-trans advocates claim, undermine attempts for integration of cis LGB individuals into the capitalist order. What I take to be at stake in the struggle for trans liberation is less a political issue than a metaphysical one, e.g., how making sexual identities visible to the state cuts off various possibilities of becoming. This paper is not meant to prescribe solutions to the problem of the lack of allyship from cis gay men and cis lesbians, but rather direct to a problem that stems from static identity categories.

The issue brought to light in this paper goes much deeper than merely debating the biology of the trans individual as current political discourse tends to follow. I am arguing that we must take a metaphysical approach to this problem—going past static notions of gender and sexuality as extant and to place in question the need for recognition politics. For Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, it is possible to escape the traps of the political and biological (which in turn generate the terms by which trans people must justify themselves) by shaking up the notion of the static categories of sexual identities and aligning it with minoritarian transness. For the purposes of my thesis, I explore Deleuze and Guattari’s thoughts, in conversation with other philosophers in the wake of May 68, to bolster a key point in the liberation of queer individuals in France. The thesis leans thus heavily on Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of becoming-imperceptible, moving away from a medicalized understanding of transness–which stems from a pathologizing of transness, and in this way conditions my argument regarding the movement of trans and gay identities. Through putting Deleuze and Guattari’s work in relation to these other thinkers, I show that first, the codification of sexual desire as homosexual or non-homosexual, or desire to express a certain gender as trans or cis, has created the conditions more precisely for policing these desires; second, and going further, the more authentic desire and its ability to produce and create has been taken from our hands through the crystallization of these categories.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Developing a Framework for Supplier Evaluation and Development: Implementation in a Manufacturing Company.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Gummadi, Vishank</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis introduces a comprehensive model for supplier evaluation and development, specifically tailored to a mid-sized manufacturer with over 40 years in waveguide component production for satellite and wireless communications. Leveraging data from the company’s ERP system, including historical purchase orders, supplier evaluations, and expenditure trends, the study identifies gaps in the existing supplier evaluation process and offers strategic enhancements. The proposed model enriches supplier assessment by integrating key objective metrics such as lead time, quality, and price, along with subjective factors like communication, environmental impact, and innovation capability. These additions provide a more comprehensive framework for supplier performance assessment, while a weighted scoring model aligns evaluations with the company’s operational priorities and long-term objectives. Subjective variables are analyzed using fuzzy logic, offering a nuanced perspective on qualitative dimensions.
To implement the model, a dual-method approach is proposed. The first method combines objective and subjective metrics into a single weighted score, while the second uses only objective metrics for the final score, applying subjective scores to adjust supplier categorization. This structured classification system groups suppliers into “Approved,” “Conditional,” “Potential,” or “Rejected” categories, equipping decision-makers with actionable insights for supplier development and risk management. By balancing immediate operational efficiency with strategic partnerships, the model positions the company to strengthen its supply chain and align with evolving industry expectations.
Building on the established framework, this study offers an in-depth model for supplier evaluation and development, integrating insights from both extensive literature and practical case studies. The proposed model emphasizes the importance of strengthening supplier-buyer relationships, which in turn enhances supply chain performance and contributes to the organization’s overall success. Furthermore, the study identifies potential areas for future research, encouraging further investigation into evolving supplier management practices and methodologies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Strictly Sequential Hybrid Theory</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Guo, Zhichang</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The Strictly Sequential Hybrid Theory (SSHT) proposed in this thesis addresses the limitations of traditional hybrid theories of well-being, which integrate subjective experiences with objective goods but struggle with "unwarranted attitudes"—attitudes not tied to objective goods yet influential on well-being. Previous enhancements like those by Wall and Sobel gave unwarranted attitudes undue significance, leading to counterintuitive effects. SSHT recalibrates this by assigning a secondary but crucial role to unwarranted attitudes, ensuring alignment with intuitive notions of well-being. It emphasizes a structured integration where objective values and warranted subjective experiences primarily determine well-being, while unwarranted attitudes are considered to resolve ties in closely matched scenarios. This approach allows SSHT to offer a more coherent and balanced framework for understanding well-being, surpassing previous models in both comprehensiveness and philosophical depth. SSHT’s nuanced method marks a significant advancement in the philosophy of well-being, contributing a refined perspective on the complex interplay between subjective and objective elements that constitute a good life.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>“Two Theses: Kenelm Digby’s Oeconomy of Nature and the Immortal Soul” investigates the role of two themes in the life’s works of Kenelm Digby (1603-1665): the idea of nature as working in a systematized way to place things to their best use; and, the idea that the human soul is immaterial, hence immune to the workings of nature, and rather immortal. This thesis argues that these two themes ought to be considered as foundational to Digby’s writings throughout his life and that their co-existence with his simultaneously scientific and experimental efforts to understand nature are mutually intertwined. Furthermore, “Two Theses: Kenelm Digby’s Oeconomy of Nature and the Immortal Soul” reveals Digby’s uniquely multifaceted project which ultimately uses mechanical philosophy to posit ideas of an interconnected nature, what we now recognize as ecological recycling, and how personal belief shapes the creation of knowledge.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Investigating the Vocabulary Spurt in Bilingual and Monolingual Infants</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>infant bilingualism, vocabulary spurt, language acquisition, vocabulary, longitudinal study</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Sometime before their second birthday, many children have a period of rapid expressive vocabulary growth called the vocabulary spurt. Theories of the underlying mechanisms differ: accumulator models emphasize the accumulation of experience with words over time to yield a spurt-like pattern, while cognitive models attribute the spurt to cognitive changes. To test these theories, English–French monolingual and bilingual children with different exposure to each language were studied. Dense, longitudinal data was analyzed from 45 infants aged 16-30 months, whose expressive vocabulary was measured on a total of 617 occasions in English and/or French. Single-language (English and/or French), concept (number of concepts lexicalized across both languages), and word (sum of both languages) vocabulary scores were computed. Infants’ exposure to each language and their exposure balance were measured using a language exposure questionnaire. Logistic curves were fitted to each infant’s data to estimate the timing (midpoint) and steepness (slope) of the vocabulary spurt in single-language, concept, and word vocabularies. 76% of infants showed a spurt in at least one vocabulary type, and bilinguals were less likely to show one in their non-dominant than their dominant language. For single-language vocabulary, infants with more exposure to a language had earlier spurts. For combined vocabularies (concept and word), monolinguals and unbalanced bilinguals had earlier and steeper spurts than balanced bilinguals. Results better support the predictions of accumulator models than cognitive theories, and show that infants follow different vocabulary acquisition trajectories based on their language background.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Haddad, Alexandra</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The thesis examines the longitudinal effects of emotion regulation and coping strategies on mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic across three phases in Quebec, Canada. We investigated how emotion regulation strategies and coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidant) shaped psychological adaptation during the pandemic. Results showed that cognitive reappraisal predicted lower baseline internalizing symptoms, while emotion-focused and avoidant coping were associated with higher initial distress. However, the effectiveness of these strategies varied, highlighting the need for flexible coping practices in prolonged crises.  An interaction between emotion-focused coping and perceived stress revealed that high levels of both led to a reduction in psychological distress over time.  Surprisingly, no effects of emotion regulation strategies on psychological distress were observed. These findings highlight how flexible coping might be beneficial during prolonged stress, offering new insights for mental health interventions in future global challenges.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>music therapy, fibromyalgia, chronic illness, self-care, musicking, health musicking</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>The purpose of this heuristic self-inquiry was to analyse the insights that might emerge when I, a chronically ill music therapist with fibromyalgia, engaged in musicking for the purpose of self-care. To do so, I utilized a heuristic self-inquiry methodology and engaged in eight 45-minute music-based self-care sessions consisting of 30 minutes of 
recreating songs that were meaningful to me, immediately followed by 15 minutes of journaling. The data generated consisted of the recorded sessions and the journal entries. The analysis revealed insights in the form of three categories (musically disingenuous, my musical identity and understanding the effect of musicking on me) each comprising 
two themes (inner critic, disengagement from the music, authentic voice, music for me, sensations and feelings provoked by the act of musicking and the powerful experience and transformation of musicking). The findings of this study allowed me to better connect 
with my musical identity and to develop music-based coping skills that will enable me to self-manage my needs as a chronically ill music therapist. The creative synthesis consists of an original song which incorporates quotes from the data produced in the journal 
entries. Implications for clinical practice, coping with chronic illness, future research, music therapy education and other helping professionals are discussed. Additionally, I express my hope for my work to encourage other helping professionals to explore how 
musicking may support them in their own self-care practices.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Accurate prediction of extreme weather events are crucial from a societal point of view, where the consequences of said events can have major financial and demographic impacts upon society.
Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides a statistical framework for the modelling of such extreme events.
On the other hand, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) extend traditional neural networks by incorporating Bayesian inference, which provides a probabilistic approach to learning and prediction in any given regression task.
In this thesis, we extend the methodology of a recently introduced BNN and integrate it with EVT to be able to infer the parameters of Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distributions.
We then apply our methodology to annual maximal rainfall in Eastern Canada, where we infer and interpolate GEV parameter estimates across the interpolation region.
The obtained results demonstrate that our approach outperforms Polynomial Regression and Inverse Distance Weighting methods in predicting extreme rainfall events.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The increasing number of skin cancers underscores the critical importance of early detection and accurate classification to improve treatment outcomes. Melanoma, a malignant skin cancer, has the highest mortality rate among all skin cancer types. Early detection of melanoma significantly enhances the chances of effective treatment and survival rates. This research presents a comparative analysis of cutting-edge deep learning methodologies in medical imaging, specifically focusing on Vision Transformers (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for melanoma cancer detection. This study further examines the influence of domain-specific transfer learning on improving melanoma detection accuracy by pre-training these deep learning models on various datasets, such as ImageNet, BreakHis, and ISIC 2019. The models are then meticulously fine-tuned using a private annotated dataset of melanoma dermoscopic images. In addition, we employed the k-fold cross-validation technique to evaluate the reliability of our models. Our experimental results highlight the significant performance of advanced deep learning methodologies and transfer learning approaches, with the ViT-B16 model achieving an exceptional diagnostic accuracy of 97.97%, outperforming other models, specifically the pre-trained CNNs models. Moreover, This study highlights the critical role of large, diverse datasets in transfer learning, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving model performance for melanoma detection.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Novel Hybrid Model for Electricity Price Forecasting Based on the Integration of Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hajigholam Saryazdi, Amirhossein</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The prediction of electricity prices plays a pivotal role in the wholesale electricity markets, influencing sale prices, bidding strategies, electricity dispatch, control, and the management of market. Notably, forecasting in a deregulated electricity market is challenging due to multiple factors such as high volatility, non-stationarity and multi-seasonality of electricity prices. In response to this challenge, this research proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model employing Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi_LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for real-time electricity price forecasting. In this model, the output sequences from the Bi_LSTM layer, which captures both past and future temporal dependencies, are directly fed into the GRU layer to refine the feature extraction. This hybrid approach not only reduces overfitting risk of a single model, but also increases robustness and adaptability of model. Three studies are conducted in New York City (NYC), electricity market to evaluate the model by systematically comparing the obtained results. First, the proposed model, Bi_LSTM-GRU, outperforms several baseline models, spanning a statistical time-series method: Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Machine Learning approaches: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Deep Learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-LSTM, GRU, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Secondly, the possibility of hybridizing CNN and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures has been examined. The proposed model also surpasses CNN-LSTM, CNN-Bi-LSTM, and CNN-GRU. Lastly, the potential contribution of data decomposition techniques in enhancing the proposed model has been assessed. It is found out that adding Wavelet Transform (WT) or Fourrier Transform (FT) to decompose the data leads to higher error rates.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Modelling, Design Optimization and Control of Magnetorheological Dampers for Prosthetic Applications</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Walking is a fundamental aspect of human life. However, for individuals who have lost one or
both legs, walking unaided is unfeasible. As a result, extensive research has been conducted on
various types of prosthetic devices. Most of traditional prostheses for above-knee (AK) amputees
rely on passive mechanisms which often cause to an awkward gait due to the lack of actuators and
external controllers. Conversely, active-mode prostheses can adjust the knee joint angle to mimic
a natural leg. However, these devices are costly, heavy, and require a substantial amount of energy
to function. Alternatively, semi-active prostheses with smart materials have demonstrated potential
to achieve stable motion without the need for expensive sensors and actuators.
The present research investigates the modeling and control of a double-ended single coil
magneto-rheological (MR) fluid damper with annular gap for a prosthetic leg application. Based
on Bingham plastic characteristics for MR fluids a quasi-static modeling of MR damper is
developed to estimate the generated damping force of the damper. Analytical magnetic circuit
analysis based on Ampere’s law is conducted to predict the magnetic flux density in the annular
gap of the MR damper. A design optimization problem is formulated to identify the optimal
geometrical design variables of the MR damper to maximize the dynamic range (ratio of the
maximum to minimum damping force of the MR damper) subject to geometrical constraints. The
optimization problem is solved using combined Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic
Programming (SQP) methods. Using the optimal parameters, a magneto-static finite element (FE)
model of the magnetic circuit is developed in open-source Finite Element Method Magnetics
(FEMM) software. Results from FE model for the magnetic flux density in the MR damper gap is
compared to those obtained from the analytical approach.
Dynamic modeling of the MR damper based on Bouc-Wen model is also investigated to
simulate the inherent hysteresis phenomenon in MR dampers. The characteristic parameters of
Bouc-Wen model are calculated using simple close-form mathematical expressions. A new
algorithm is developed to automatically extract model parameters from the experimental dataset
allowing faster parameter estimation than conventional optimization approaches.
A dynamic model of the prosthetic leg integrated with MR damper is developed using the
Lagrange method, followed by an analysis of the desired hip and knee angles throughout the gait
cycle. A polynomial approximation is then formulated to estimate the knee angle based on the hip
joint angle. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of three
control methods (feed-forward control, robust inverse dynamic control, and adaptive inverse
dynamic control) in supporting the amputee to achieve a natural gait.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Optimal transportation scheduling is crucial to improve the performance of the panelized construction supply chain. Previous studies lack transportation scheduling approaches for distribution and reverse logistics in panelized construction as a bridge to balance factory and site operations. To address the current gaps, this research proposes a genetic algorithm-based optimization framework to generate optimal distribution and reverse transportation schedules and on-site unloading schedules, considering a diverse transportation fleet (trucks and trailers), multiple sites, multiple panel types, on-site parking limitations, and assembly sequence while ensuring continuity of factory production and on-site operations. The proposed model extends and improves the existing transportation models by considering the distribution and reverse transportation operations and introducing design constraints in the transportation practices of the panelized construction. Results demonstrated that the method achieves transportation fleet efficiency of 98.8% and ensures seamless on-site operations, offering an invaluable planning tool for project managers and enhancing resource allocation for factory and construction sites.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Impact of Background Complexity on Social Media Engagement and Purchase Intentions: The Role of Influencer Type and Sponsorship Disclosure</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Han, Yichen</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>As social media continues to play an increasingly prominent role in people’s daily lives, numerous brands leverage sponsored content on these platforms to garner attention and attract potential consumers. In this research, I focus on understanding how the background complexity of images used in social media posts can influence both social media engagement and purchase intentions. In a first study, I investigate the potential moderating role of influencer type on the impact of background complexity on social media engagement, as well as purchase intentions. In a second study, I analyze whether sponsorship disclosure plays a moderating role in this interaction. The findings revealed that background complexity did not significantly impact social media engagement or purchase intentions. Furthermore, influencer type and sponsorship disclosure did not have a significant influence on these outcomes. Despite this, my research still offers valuable insights and avenues for future research. Specifically, this research suggests various practical implications for brands and marketers when crafting sponsored content for social media platforms. It also sheds a light on the roles of background complexity, influencer type, and sponsorship disclosure in shaping individuals’ social media engagement and purchase intentions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Optimization of Pre-Operative Planning in Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgeries with Deep Learning-based Patient-Specific 3D Modeling and Intuitive VR Interaction</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Harirpoush, Arash</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the application of deep learning algorithms within extended reality to enhance preoperative planning in minimally invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). VATS faced technical challenges, such as a limited field of view and complex anatomical structures, which require precise, patient-specific 3D modeling and intuitive data interaction for effective planning.
While deep learning, particularly U-shaped architectures, has emerged as a powerful approach for generating these models through automated segmentation of preoperative medical images, the growing number of U-shaped models with diverse network configurations and attention mechanisms requires systematic evaluation.
Our first contribution addresses this need through a comprehensive benchmark study of U-shaped models, focusing on their segmentation accuracy and computational complexity. The study reveals the effectiveness of CNN-based U-shaped architectures for thoracic anatomical segmentation, with residual blocks playing a crucial role in enhancing network performance. These findings provide essential guidance for model selection and development in surgical planning applications, where the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency is important.
Building upon these segmentation capabilities, our second contribution introduces an innovative extended reality system for optimizing trocar placement in VATS procedures. Optimal trocar placement is crucial to ensuring comprehensive thoracic cavity access, maintaining panoramic endoscopic visualization, and preventing instrument crowding. Our system features tailored visualization and interaction designs that enable surgeons to explore trocar configurations preoperatively using patient-specific 3D models. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates the system's efficiency, robustness, and user-friendliness, establishing its potential for clinical implementation while offering valuable insights for future surgical XR system development.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Oil Spill Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Oil Fingerprinting, Remote Sensing</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Oil spills significantly threaten marine environment, damaging ecosystem, wildlife, and coastal communities. This thesis addresses these challenges by employing both advanced machine learning techniques and satellite imagery analysis technologies to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of oil spill detection and or source identification. By utilizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and examining semantic segmentation models, the research aims to accurately detect oil spills based on satellite images. Additionally, oil fingerprinting techniques, involving unsupervised classification are used to identify the sources of marine oil spills, providing a comprehensive framework for oil spill monitoring and management. The methodology involves the use of three distinct datasets: a multi-class dataset for detecting oil spills using satellite images, a binary dataset focusing on oil spill incidents in the Gulf of Suez from 2017 to 2021 as a case study for oil spill detection and a dataset for oil fingerprinting based on samples from the MV Manolis L shipwreck. For oil spill detection, semantic segmentation models were trained and evaluated using these datasets. Performance metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) were used to assess the modeling accuracy. Secondly for oil fingerprinting, PCA and HCA were applied to analyze the chemical composition data of the MV Manolis L. oil samples to identify their similarities and differences for oil source classification. 
The results indicate that DeepLabv3+ and UNet++ models achieved the highest mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores for multi-class and binary segmentation tasks, respectively, demonstrating their robustness in detecting oil spills. Specifically, DeepLabv3+ achieved a mIoU of 68.3% in the multi-class dataset, excelling in complex categories like oil spills and look-alikes. UNet++ achieved a mIoU of 87.5% in the binary dataset, highlighting its effectiveness in distinguishing oil from non-oil regions. For oil fingerprinting, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model exhibited the highest accuracy, particularly in predicting the composition of n-alkanes, PAHs, and TPH, with F-scores of 1.0, 0.987, and 0.975, respectively. These findings underscore the effectiveness of coupling advanced machine learning models with established chemical analysis techniques, offering a reliable approach for oil spill detection and the subsequent effective cleanup.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are essential in electronic devices, where even minor defects
can signifcantly impact products and the environment. Thus, rigorous quality control is imperative
in PCB manufacturing. This thesis tackles critical challenges by developing robust strategies for
defect detection and accurately predicting repair needs. It begins with an extensive background on
current fault detection and repair strategies. Central to this study is the use of advanced machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to enhance the accuracy of the PCB labeling process, integrating data from Solder Paste Inspection (SPI) and Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI)
datasets. The research is structured into distinct phases, each addressing different aspects of the
PCB manufacturing process. The initial phase focuses on improving the prediction of human inspection labels using advanced ML and DL techniques, particularly addressing the challenges of
imbalanced datasets with synthetic data augmentation techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN).
The subsequent phase expands ML algorithms to refne the process of assigning ”RepairLabel” to
PCBs, incorporating ensemble methods and sophisticated feature engineering to boost accuracy and
effciency. The proposed methods have shown promising results, demonstrating their substantial potential for real-world applications. The thesis concludes with a summary of fndings and discusses
the implications for PCB manufacturing. It also outlines potential directions for future research,
suggesting further enhancements in fault detection techniques and the development of more intelligent and effcient systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Hatami, Maryam</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The rapid growth of IoT technologies demands seamless integration of communication protocols, es- pecially for devices in constrained environments. This thesis focuses on integrating LoRaWAN with IPv6 networks by developing a secure and autonomous framework for managing SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) contexts. The research aims to create a secure, human-free solution that maintains reasonable data transmission times between LoRaWAN and IPv6, essential for widespread IoT adoption. For instance, in smart agriculture, dynamic SCHC updates support equipment mobility; in industrial automation, SCHC ensures consistent data transmission amid changing topologies; in smart cities, it adapts to evolving infras- tructure; and in healthcare, it manages reliable health data transmission.
The thesis introduces the concept of SCHC Zero Context, enabling immediate device communication by embedding pre-configured SCHC rules during manufacturing. This innovation facilitates an efficient bootstrapping process. Additionally, a comparative analysis of BRSKI (Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure) and cBRSKI (constrained BRSKI) demonstrates the feasibility of the solution for energy- constrained IoT devices.
The research underscores the importance of integrating security across IoT architecture layers. By com- bining LoRaWAN’s data link layer security with IPv6’s global internet, the proposed framework offers robust protection against common threats, ensuring secure onboarding and communication throughout a de- vice’s life-cycle.
This work provides a scalable, secure solution for integrating LoRaWAN with IPv6, laying the ground- work for future research in secure and efficient dynamic SCHC context management.</etd_ms:description>

Business–Police Relations in Halifax’s North End Neighbourhood</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hazineh, Alia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>As profit-seeking consumption spaces, sustained by wage labor, local businesses generally em-brace neighbourhood police practices. Yet, whether business-police relationships differ across business spaces, has been largely undocumented and unexplored within the academic literature. This research uses North End, Halifax as a case study to investigate how businesses influence po-licing practices both within their own space and within the neighborhood more broadly. Using abo-lition as my geographical method, I study business spaces as potential commons: sites for prefigu-rative politics, or abolitionist geographies in the making, while remaining attentive to the ways business spaces resist these framings, and instead map on to carceral geographies. I carry out this analysis in the form of a three-part audio documentary series, included here as three written scripts. Interviews with business owners, business association board members, and long-term res-idents, living and working in the North End between the 1960s and today, populate these scripts, showing how diverse actors have mediated and understood safety, and policing, across time and space. Altogether, this research situates neighbourhood businesses within the complex Canadian landscapes of carcerality, while also aiming to document how these same businesses might, and have been, sites of radical placemaking and abolitionist futures to come.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The growing complexity and precision required in modern manufacturing processes have led to an increased use of automation and robotics, particularly in advanced composite material fabrication techniques such as Automated Fiber Placement (AFP). This thesis explores the ways to improve the fiber placement process and quality through the use of dual robot systems. The principal objective of this research is to investigate the potential of dual-robot systems to improve the precision and efficiency of fiber placement on dome-type geometries with singularity avoidance, particularly within the aerospace industries.

In this study, a dual robot system consisting of two industrial robots, i.e., Fanuc M20-iA with an automated fiber placement (AFP) head and a second robot are used to simulate the fiber placement process on a curved, dome-type surface. A typical example of this type of geometry in aerospace structures is a fuselage pressure bulkhead. RoboDK, an offline robot simulation and programming tool, is employed</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Accessibility has become one of the predominant ways of understanding the relationship between transportation and land use in urban areas. Traditional measures of accessibility understand it unimodally or comparatively, without consideration of the dynamics of a multimodal transportation system. Multimodal, or mode share weighted accessibility (MWA) measures, take into account observed mode shares of the underlying geographic units and apply them to the accessibility to employment provided by that mode share. The individual MWA values are then added to give a singular MWA value. In this research MWA models are created for over 20 Canadian census metropolitan areas. They’re presented at regional and census tract levels, where the latter are then used in regression models to understand correlations that exist between MWA and socioeconomic and demographic factors. Inferential statistics are used to estimate differences in means of the socioeconomic and demographic variables of the top and bottom quintiles of MWA in every region. Many of the socioeconomic factors were found to be significantly corelated with MWA, with higher MWA values being associated with higher median household incomes, lower proportions of renters, and typically lower population density and lower proportions of visible minorities and immigrants. This is the first study to use multimodal accessibility models to understand the relationships between accessibility and socioeconomic factors across large- and medium-sized metropolitan regions in Canada.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Ho, Sharon Chee Yin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The growing interest to incorporate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) image tools into creative workflows has raised concerns about the social and ethical implications it may have on Japan’s creative industries. This exploratory study is the first to discuss what oversights may emerge on such issues from prospective Japanese generative AI researchers- computer science (CS) graduate students studying in Japan. From June 2023 to August 2023, nine CS graduate students studying in Tokyo were interviewed to understand how CS graduate students in Japan discuss GenAI image tools’ 1) technical aspects, 2) social and ethical aspects, and 3) cultures in AI research, as well as three experts to investigate the 4) legal, social, and cultural impacts of using GenAI image tools for creative work in Japan. The results indicate that CS graduate students do discuss various ethical and social aspects with GenAI image tools, but many neglected to see how widespread industry usage in Japan has the ability to further marginalize artists in creative workplaces and jeopardize critical aspects of workplace pedagogy in creative industries. This study provides insight into the mindsets of prospective GenAI researchers in Japan and indicates areas of future work that can better prepare them as future knowledge holders and innovators in the field. AI researchers from Canada, Japan, and around the world are encouraged to adopt participatory AI design practices to involve stakeholders throughout the planning, design, and evaluation processes of GenAI image research so they respond to the needs, values, and concerns of artists and creative professionals.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effect of Rehabilitative Care Provided to Individuals In an Inclusive Space Following Gender-Affirming Top Surgery</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hobbs, Elena</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Gender-affirming top surgery is an important procedure for members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. There are currently no standardized aftercare recommendations nor consistent timelines for rehabilitation following top surgery. The purpose of our study was to measure patient-reported outcomes, including upper limb function, pain interference, neuropathic pain, embodiment, role limitations due to physical health, social functioning, and general health, in individuals receiving top surgery, over an 11-week rehabilitation program.

Forty-two gender diverse individuals from the general population participated. Participants started individualized rehabilitative aftercare 10-days post-operatively, which included one 60-minute treatment per week, for 11-weeks. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scale (DASH) and 4 other questionnaires were completed prior to surgery, then again at weeks 1, 5, and 11 post-op. Separate repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to identify differences in all measures among the 4 time points.

After top surgery individuals experience significant disruption to upper limb function, similar to other invasive upper extremity surgeries. During the rehabilitation, our participants experienced a significant statistical and clinical improvement in upper limb function while pain was not a limiting factor during the treatment. Participants reported avoiding about 3 less environments or social experiences which represents a clinically significant improvement in patient-reported embodiment.

The results of our study demonstrate the benefit of standard post-operative rehabilitative care in patients undergoing gender-affirming top surgery. The timeline for rehabilitative care used in this study can be applied, by qualified care providers, for future individuals who have undergone gender-affirming top surgery.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Replaying the Past: Queer Canadian Documentary as Counter-Archive</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Holzberg, Maxfield Peter Holmes</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Queer Cinema, Queer Studies, Counter-Archive, Archival Studies, Canadian Studies</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Archives have traditionally privileged hegemonic and normative histories, often excluding marginalized people and their memories. Emerging after the archival turn of the 1990s, "counter-archival" scholarship appeared in the early 2010s, to expand definitions of "archive" to include a more diverse body of materials and historiographical methods. These alternative processes and repositories, known as a counter-archive, can be a community archival collection, an oral history practice, a curated exhibition, an archival methodology that expresses a non-dominant sensibility, artistic practice, or more. A counter-archive typically speaks to, preserves, or represents non-dominant memories from queer, racialized, diasporic, differently abled, or Indigenous peoples, whose subjectivities may often intersect or overlap. In this thesis, I consider queer Canadian documentary film as a counter-archive, one which is a process to preserve subjective and affective memory, but also as a repository, a living collection which replays these memories. I explore how queer counter-archives use queer cinematic aesthetics, archival artefacts, talking head interviews, voiceover narration and re-enactments to preserve and replay memories of queer subjects who have resisted the pull of heteronormativity, but also how creative preservation practices express the affect, relationality, and subjectivity of queer sensibility. I analyze two queer Canadian documentaries, Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives (Dir. Lynne Fernie Aerlynn Weissman, 1992) and Sea in the Blood (Dir. Richard Fung, 2000). Using Muñoz’s queer utopia framework, I explore how counter-archives replay memory to produce queer utopias, visions of a world determined by queer sensibility, a way-finder towards a place charted by self-determined subjectivity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The examination of brand reputation has constituted a focal point within the realm of marketing, albeit with a dearth of exploration within the business crisis literature. This paper tries to contribute to this literature by elucidating the brand reputation’s dualistic impact during a crisis, consequently seeking to reconcile the previous varied results. We demonstrated that a pre-crisis transitory brand reputation (TBR) can exacerbate the damage of the crisis for less-reputed brands while a long-term prior brand reputation has a positive role after a data breach crisis. Additionally, we have shown that the negative effect of TBR is more vivid for B2C firms. We introduced the paradox of transitory resources that states in order to obtain long-term resources to preserve the brand in times of crisis, one should obtain transitory resources that backfire. We build our hypotheses based on the Expectation-Evidence framework and the literature on the data breach crisis. We used Twitter (rebranded as “X”) to gather and analyze stakeholder-generated content before the crisis. The sentiment analysis approach based on a bag of words is used in an event study methodology and cumulative abnormal return is the dependent variable. The findings of this study underscore the importance of a robust and enduring long-term brand reputation for businesses. Furthermore, a shift away from reliance on transient advertisements, returns, and reputational constructs is necessary for the firms to successfully recover after a crisis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Chemical and electrochemical analysis of aqueous redox flow battery electrolytes</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>IMHANRIA, SARAH</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are emerging as a robust solution for large-scale energy storage, crucial for meeting the growing demand for sustainable power sources. While conventional RFBs typically utilize metallic based electrolytes, aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are gaining momentum as a cost-effective and safer alternative. This study delves into the electrochemical characteristics of key redox couples, 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone (1,2-DHAQ) and ferrocyanide (FeCN) to assess their potential for AORFB applications. Employing cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry, we evaluated their redox reversibility, pH stability, kinetic parameters, and diffusion coefficients. This study reveals that both 1,2-DHAQ and FeCN exhibit quasi-reversible redox behavior, with peak separations (ΔE) of 58 mV and 100 mV, respectively. The half-wave potentials (E1/2) versus an Ag/AgCl reference of 0.864 V for 1,2-DHAQ and 0.253 V for FeCN indicate their suitability as negolyte and posolyte, respectively. In addition, 1,2-DHAQ’s redox behavior is influenced by pH due to proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanisms, while FeCN’s redox potential remains stable across pH variations due to its coordination with cyanide ligands. Kinetic analyses showed that 1,2-DHAQ has a charge transfer coefficient (α) of 0.23 and a rate constant (k0) of 1.05 × 10⁻³ cm/s, compared to FeCN’s α of 0.7 and k0 of 1.2 × 10⁻³ cm/s. Diffusion coefficients, determined via the Randles-Sevcik equation, were 1.78 × 10⁻⁶ cm²/s for 1,2-DHAQ and 2.17 × 10⁻⁶ cm²/s for FeCN. 
1,2-DHAQ electrolytes were cycled in both symmetric and full cell configurations and found to decrease in capacity over time. To understand the source of this capacity fade, aliquots of cycled electrolyte were analysed via CV and UV-Vis spectroscopy to track the concentration of 1,2-DHAQ over time. Although capacity fade was always associated with a decrease in 1,2-DHAQ concentration, the amounts were not consistently in quantitative agreement, suggesting that more work needs to be done to identify and quantify degradation mechanisms. Lastly, a combination of CV and open-circuit voltage (OCV) measurements were used to estimate the state of charge (SOC) of electrolytes. This method was found to be effective for quasi-reversible systems like 1,2-DHAQ and FeCN but less accurate for irreversible systems like the V4+/V5+ redox couple. The study also validated the use of a pseudo-reference electrode, which simplifies experimental setup and reduces contamination risks, thus enhancing the reliability of SOC measurements.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Ibarra-Lemay, Alicia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research explores the process of intergenerational healing through the reconnection with family stories, with a focus on working alongside my own family, particularly with my totà (grandparent). Using storywork as the primary methodology, the study involves methods such as conversations, place-based reconnection and reflective journaling. Conversational methods fostered a relational space for family members to share, exchange and co-create narratives, while place-based reconnection involved visiting significant ancestral lands to ground these stories in physical and cultural contexts. Reflective journaling offered a space for me to document my insights, analyze experiences and engage in self-reflection as part of my own healing journey. 

The research delves into the impacts of colonial legacies, particularly residential and day schools, which have caused intergenerational trauma and cultural disconnections. Through a deeply personal lens, this research demonstrates that reconnecting with family stories honors past generations and empowers current and future ones to engage in cultural continuity, to strengthen familial bonds and to heal from intergenerational trauma. This research highlights how stories bridge the past, present and future, providing both individual and collective pathways toward resilience and identity strengthening, while also being guided by and grounded in relational principles. Throughout I draw on Kanien’kehá notions of karihwakwenienstáhtshera (respect), iaoterihwaienni (responsibility), tetewatatawíhon (reciprocity), iorihowá:nen ne onkwaio'ténhsera (reverence), tewake'nikonhrahsa'áhton (holism), ska'nikonra (synergy) and interrelatedness to reflect upon my family’s story.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Multi-Satellite Network Size Estimation and Scalable
Resource Allocation Mechanisms in Direct-to-Satellite IoT</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ilabaca, Pablo</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are crucial for connecting Internet of Things (IoT) networks globally. They facilitate Direct-to-Satellite (DtS) communications, especially in remote areas lacking terrestrial infrastructure. Although Low-Power Wireless Area technologies, such as LoRa, provide long-range connectivity in DtS-IoT networks, scalability remains a significant challenge due to heavy channel congestion associated with large-scale deployments. The LoRa Optimistic Collision Information-based (L-OCI) estimator was introduced to address a satellite's insufficient awareness of possible congestion in its service area by estimating network size. However, this mechanism was designed for a single LEO satellite.


This thesis introduces Constellation L-OCI (CL-OCI), a novel mechanism for estimating network size in multi-satellite constellations. CL-OCI integrates estimations from multiple satellites, accounting for their ground track deviations relative to the node deployment region, and groups the node population for estimation by each satellite. We thoroughly tested CL-OCI using FloRaSat, a discrete-event satellite constellation simulator in realistic orbital DtS-IoT scenarios. The results show significant scalability improvement, doubling the number of nodes it can estimate and reducing node-energy costs by seven-fold compared to LoRa/LoRaWAN OCI.

Leveraging OCI benefits, we apply the network size estimator in two novel window selection mechanisms for Aloha-based MAC protocols, namely Frame Selection Game and Intelligent Probabilistic, tailored for device sets of unknown size. These mechanisms enable nodes to select advantageous time frames for channel contention through network size estimation. Extensive simulations in Matlab demonstrate that these mechanisms outperform traditional Frame Slotted Aloha protocols, improving scalability to accommodate up to 1,500 nodes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines the rapid, uncritical adoption of ChatGPT, a widely used generative AI model, by focusing on students' perceptions and use of the tool for writing tasks. The study explores three main questions: how learners use ChatGPT, the advantages and disadvantages they identify, and their awareness of its ethical implications. Using a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 university students and recent graduates, followed by thematic analysis to uncover recurring patterns. Findings show that participants mainly used ChatGPT for drafting, research, editing, and brainstorming, valuing its efficiency and usability. However, they expressed concerns over generic, repetitive outputs, limited research capabilities, and the risk of deskilling, fearing dependence on the tool might erode their own skills. While participants recognized some ethical issues, particularly in education, disinformation, and privacy, awareness of bias, transparency, and sustainability was limited. Despite these drawbacks, participants generally maintained a positive attitude towards ChatGPT, with a strong interest in maximizing its benefits while attempting to manage its limitations. This study underscores the need for promoting critical engagement with AI through Human-Centred AI (HCAI), which emphasizes ethical considerations in technology use. The findings lay a foundation for future research aimed at addressing misconceptions about generative AI and creating educational strategies for ethical AI integration.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Online Bipartite Matching under Markov Chain Model</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ishaan, Arnav</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Online bipartite matching (OBM) has a rich history in the literature of online algorithms, where it has been an influential problem inspiring many algorithms and techniques. This problem of obtaining a matching set of maximum size where vertices of one bi-partition arrive online has many real-world applications from kidney donor exchange to online advertising. This has led to the problem being studied under a variety of input models. In the adversarial model it is known that the tight competitive ratio is $1-1/e$ (among all randomized algorithms). Lower and upper bounds on competitive ratios better than $1-1/e$ are known for random order model, known and unknown IID models and other stochastic models, where a major open problem is to close these gaps.

One feature of the stochastic input models (e.g., known and unknown IID input models) under which OBM has been studied so far is the assumption of strong independence among the input items. One of the main conceptual contributions of this thesis is to introduce a stochastic input model that allows us to simulate limited dependence. In our model, input nodes are sampled from a Markov chain, and we refer to this as the Markov chain model. Introducing Markov chain significantly increases the complexity of analysis of algorithms by adding a number of parameters: initial distribution, transition probabilities, sampling size, etc, which leads us to concentrate on analyzing the problem for some specific families of bipartite graphs and Markov chains.

In particular, we study two algorithms \textsc{Non Adaptive} and \textsc{Adaptive Two Suggested Matching} under the Markov chain input model for parameterized versions of lazy random walks on $(2,2)$-biregular type graphs. We give an alternative characterization of an offline optimal solution, $OPT$, for these stochastic inputs, which allows us to calculate exactly (in the limit) the expected size of matching of $OPT$. We then proceed to obtain tight bounds on the sizes of matchings obtained by the two algorithms under asymptotic conditions, which combined with the bound on $OPT$, gives us tight competitive ratios of $0.9509$ and $0.9733$ for the \textsc{Non Adaptive} and \textsc{Adaptive} algorithms, respectively. These are competitive ratios for the classical lazy random walk Markov chain, where the probability of staying put is $1/2$. We also derive exact formulas for competitive ratios with respect to lazy walks parameterized by $p$ -- the probability of staying put.

We believe these results, which use two disjoint matchings and regularity of graph degrees could be extended to type graphs of degree at most $k$ (for any constant $k$), and to bipartite graphs that admit several disjoint matchings of large sizes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Towards Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Automation using Machine
Learning</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Islam, Saidul</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a critical intervention aimed at restoring vital blood circulation and breathing in individuals experiencing cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, representing a crucial aspect of emergency medical care. Numerous biomedical signals are associated with CPR execution and monitoring, from initial out-of-hospital treatment to the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Machine learning (ML) can play a crucial role in automating the CPR process by utilizing signals to identify complex patterns and in decision-making. In this context, we explored the existing role of ML in CPR and analyzed current ML approaches for various CPR-related tasks in this thesis. Our review highlights research gaps and sets new directions for empirical studies, uncovering the unexplored potential of ML applications in CPR. Through the analysis, we identified that CPR signals often suffer from noise, complicating accurate clinical interpretation and decision-making. Conventional denoising methods using filters exhibit limitations in addressing the complex noise characteristics inherent in CPR signals. Although ML is known for handling complex data characteristics, a dedicated ML-based unsupervised approach for denoising CPR signals is still missing. To this end, we proposed a novel ML framework tailored for denoising biomedical signals during CPR. Utilizing a multi-modality approach, our framework leverages a dedicated ML algorithm for individual signals while concurrently denoising multiple signals through unsupervised ML approaches considering real-life scenarios. Our framework demonstrates significant noise removal and signal fidelity enhancements. Furthermore, our methodology preserves signal correlations, essential for downstream tasks. Finally, the proposed framework aims to improve CPR monitoring and decision-making, offering adaptability and extensibility to denoise a range of biomedical signals beyond CPR scenarios.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Economic Assimilation of Immigrants in Quebec</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Issa, Ali</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this paper, I examine the wages and work hours of immigrants in Quebec and the rest of Canada. By analyzing data from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) for the years 1999 to 2011, I explore three key questions about the economic integration of immigrants relative to native-born individuals. The first question examines the initial wage gap for new immigrants, defined as those who have lived in Canada for less than ten years at the time of data collection. The second question assesses whether this wage gap changes significantly over the sample period. The third question examines the extent of economic assimilation in immigrant earnings as their residency in Canada lengthens. The findings reveal a significant initial wage gap, with new immigrants earning 28.8% less than their native counterparts. Over the sample period, this gap narrowed by 1.3% annually. Additionally, the analysis indicates that economic assimilation is substantial, though rates vary between Quebec and the rest
of Canada. Initially, assimilation occurs more quickly in Quebec, whereas over time, immigrant earnings rise more rapidly outside Quebec. To further explore the economic assimilation of immigrants, I investigate their work hours and find that new immigrants work fewer hours than their native counterparts. As with the wage gap, the immigrant-native gap in work hours narrows as immigrants stay longer in Canada. To understand these assimilation effects on both wages and work hours, I analyze a simple model of learning by doing (LBD) and show that the model can account for the key observed patterns of wages and hours worked among immigrants in the SLID.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Evaluating EEG as a prognostic tool to predict persistent symptoms in adolescents with concussion</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Iuliano, Sofia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Approximately 30% of children with concussion experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS), but no accurate prognostic tools are available. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies alterations in electrical activity post-concussion, but its prognostic capability is unknown. Our objective was to determine if EEG outperforms current prognostic tools in predicting PPCS at 1-month post-concussion. Thirty-four adolescents (12.9 +/- 2.2 years, 20 males) with concussion were recruited. The treating physician predicted the likelihood of PPCS (0-100) at diagnosis in the emergency room. Participants completed a resting-state EEG and a brief clinical assessment battery 6.4 +/- 2.4 days post-injury and the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) 28.9 +/- 1.9 days post-injury. PPCS (yes/no) was defined as an increase of ≥7 points on the PCSI compared to pre-injury symptom ratings. Twelve (35.3%) participants experienced PPCS at 1-month post-injury. Independent t-tests found that F3 delta power (p=0.04), F4 delta power (p=0.1), and F4 theta power (p=0.07) differed in adolescents with and without PPCS, which were combined into a multivariable model. Using inferential approaches, the EEG model had an AUC=0.71 (sensitivity=75%, specificity=68.2%) compared to the 5P Score (AUC=0.66, sensitivity=75%, specificity=45.9%) and physician prediction (AUC=0.55, sensitivity=71.4%, specificity=38.9%) models. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.60 and p=0.32 respectively). The optimal machine learning model (SVM radial kernel, C=0.2) found that only the EEG performed significantly better than random chance in the training (72.9% accuracy, p&lt;0.001) and validation set (62%, p&lt;0.001). EEG features have potential as a prognostic biomarker of PPCS. Future studies should include larger samples and different EEG systems and features.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Characterization of ORF19.7608 (PPP1), a Biofilm-induced Gene Encoding a Protein of Unknown Function in Candida albicans</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Iwuchukwu, Nmerichukwu</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Biofilms are a major source of pathogenicity in Candida albicans and are connected to about half the deaths due to systemic candidiasis. Biofilm formation is controlled by a transcriptional network and involves over a thousand genes including a small gene we have named PPP1 (Punctate Pattern Protein 1). This is a biofilm-upregulated gene encoding an unexamined protein found only in Candida albicans and its sister species Candida dubliniensis. In this study, we characterize this protein by analysing its effect on biofilm formation and its cellular localization. We focus on fluorescent microscopy to identify its subcellular localization and links to other cellular processes. First, we tagged Ppp1 with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and imaged the protein expression pattern. This expression pattern was used to identify subcellular compartments with similar patterns and direct knockouts and tags of proteins defining these domains. Next, we screened the mutant and complement strain through stress and invasive assays and confocal microscopy to identify a distinct phenotype. Disruptions and tagging of Sur7 defining the eisosome and Arc35 defining the actin cytoskeleton suggested that Ppp1 was not a component of either the eisosome or actin cytoskeleton. However, tagging Sed5, a Golgi defining protein, identified colocalization between the puncta. Since there is no clear distinction between Golgi compartment proteins and secretory proteins, we tagged and analyzed Sap2 and compared data with results for Ppp1. We also tagged Orf19.6274 and Orf19.4654, proteins with similar characteristics to Ppp1 and compared their patterns to Ppp1 puncta. These experiments support a model that Ppp1 is localized in the Golgi.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>soundwalking soundscape intergenerationality aging teenagers amplification</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>What might the soundscape of a rural historic bridge tell us about ourselves? This thesis examines how soundwalking created opportunities for intergenerational connection, by inviting participants living in a common geographical area to explore a particular bridge, its soundscape and oral history. The historic Avoca Bridge, located in the rural community of Avoca in Quebec’s Lower Laurentians, is the materialization of commonality between members of different generations as they cross over the Rouge River. During the fall of 2023, I led a research-creation intervention with five older adults and one teenage participant, during which they were introduced to amplified and deep listening, and learned about the oral history of the Avoca Bridge. The culminating activity was a soundwalk on the bridge, where participants used digital voice recorders and headphones to amplify the site-specific soundscape. This paper is divided into three chapters. Chapter 1 explores delay as affective response, and as a sound effect. Chapter 2 examines material aspects of the bridge and how these are parallel to participants’ responses. Chapter 3 offers a brief history of soundwalking, with particular attention to Andra McCartney’s seminal work on the practice, followed by a discussion of theoretical and methodological considerations relating to the use of amplification. The overall experience is described and examined through excerpts from participant-created audio recordings, recorded group conversations, and my own notes. The notion of a society where beneficial intergenerational connections are made possible thanks to an interruption to age-segregated practices is explored.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In recent times, scholarly attention on Wide-bandgap (WBG) devices, like silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) transistors, focuses on power conversion for heightened efficiency in electric vehicles. GaN HEMTs, with superior characteristics like low on-resistance and high-speed switching, enable compact power converters with increased integration and power density, crucial for EV advancement.
GaN-powered converters require accurate models for device behavior. Manufacturers use internal data and physics-based models, but these are unavailable to the public and time-consuming to develop. Accurate analytical models, mimicking transistor dynamics and predicting energy loss, offer a solution without extensive computational demands.This thesis validates superior GaN device switching model, proven via experiments and reduced parasitics confirmed with double pulse tests, affirming enhanced accuracy.
 Due to the fast switching of GaN device, high voltage slew rate or dv/dt at the inverter output gives rise to switching harmonics, higher voltage stress at the motor winding, and EMI issues in the motor drive system. This thesis conducts a comprehensive review of filter design for GaN-based inverters to attenuate the harmonics and hence mitigate the high dv/dt and EMI issues. A case study is also provided for a three-phase inverter developed. Another limitation of GaN-based converter technology has resulted from the limited voltage and current capability of GaN transistors available in the market. To apply GaN transistors in high-power applications, multi-phase multi-level converter design is also investigated in this thesis. A comparative study on a new neutral pointless multi-level inverter against the traditional topologies is carried out.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Mobile Augmented Reality Application For the Education of Neurovascular System</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The human brain is a complex organ consisting of intricate vascular networks that supply local regions that control various aspects of our body functions. Understanding the vascular neuroanatomy and the associated territories is essential for diagnosing and treating cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke. Traditional anatomical education relies on 2D illustrations and physical dissections, which often fail to provide a comprehensive understanding of 3D anatomical structures. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies offer immersive 3D visualizations, potentially enabling more effective learning experiences. In this thesis, we present NeuroVase, a tablet-based AR application designed to enhance stroke-related neuroanatomy learning. NeuroVase employs a novel dual-modal setup that leverages physical cue cards as the medium to interact with AR learning content and offer off-line textual learning materials. For the application, we developed a new learning curriculum for the cerebrovascular system with the care of stroke in mind. Users can inspect and explore the brain’s vascular territories, understand how blockages in major arteries can lead to specific types of strokes and symptoms, and access key knowledge summaries and 3D anatomical models and MRI. NeuroVase intends to address the limitations of traditional learning methods by offering a more interactive, engaging, and accessible learning tool. The included learning material in NeuroVase can potentially help support time-sensitive treatment decisions and improve prognosis assessment for cerebrovascular conditions, such as stroke. Our platform with modular learning materials was designed with flexibility in mind, making it easy to incorporate additional learning units as needed. Through our user study with 20 participants, the results suggest that NeuroVase could serve as a user-friendly and effective academic and clinical educational tool.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Elucidating The Structure and Dynamics of Aurein Peptides in Solution and Micellar Environments Using Biomolecular Simulations</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the innate immune system of many species from plants to mammals, showing antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms. Aurein peptides are a family of AMPs isolated from amphibians, displaying antibacterial and anticancer activity. In this work, we study the structure and dynamics of a set of Aurein peptides in aqueous solution and micellar environment using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We study six Aurein peptides, four of which are experimentally known to have antibacterial and anticancer activity (Aureins 1.2, 2.2, 2.5, and 3.1); and two longer Aurein peptides (Aureins 4.1 and 5.1) that are inactive. We build Markov state models (MSMs) to investigate the conformations of the peptides and transitions between different folding intermediates. Aurein 1.2 is an experimentally well-characterized peptide; there is literature reporting on the structures of Aurein 2.2 and 2.5. Our data show that the active Aureins visit three conformational states in solution: alpha-helical, partially alpha-helical, and random coil. The inactive Aureins show rapid transitions between short-lived conformations, and their MSMs were not reproducible. The simulations of Aureins 1.2 and 2.5 in micelles has shown that these peptides retain their folded α-helical structure in a hydrophobic environment. The secondary amide proton chemical shifts of Aurein 1.2 in micelle environments differing in the number of detergent molecules were computed and compared to the available experimental data. The micelle simulations comprising 80 SDS molecules agree well with the experimental data, suggesting that our simulations can predict the folding of Aurein peptides in micelles. Our results show that combining molecular simulations with MSMs enables the prediction of in-micelle conformations for Aurein peptides lacking experimental structures.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>60 GHz High Gain Magneto Electric Dipole Antenna Array</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jalali Moghadam, Marjan Sadat</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Millimeter-wave frequencies have gained significant attention in recent years due to their vast potential for high-bandwidth communications. These frequencies, typically ranging from 30 GHz to 300 GHz, offer abundant available bandwidth for data-intensive applications. However, their efficient utilization requires the development of high-gain and low-profile antenna systems capable of operating at these frequencies. This research introduces a design of a high-gain, magneto-electric dipole (ME-Dipole) antenna array fed through a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW), incorporating mushroom beam-directors.
The aim of this thesis is to address the growing demand for efficient millimeter-wave antennas for wireless communication systems. In the proposed antenna structure, the integration of Epsilon-Near-Zero (ENZ) lenses within the design substantially enhances the directivity of the radiation pattern.
The single element of the ME-Dipole exhibits a maximum gain of 7.84 dBi, providing a significant boost in signal strength. By utilizing an array configuration with 1 × 8 elements, the antenna system achieves an impressive gain of 18 dBi, appropriate for long-range and high throughput communication links. The measurement data validates the antenna’s performance, demonstrating a 10dB impedance bandwidth spanning 33.3 (from 54 GHz to 74 GHz). Furthermore, the maximum
gain of 18 dBi exhibits remarkable gain flatness, with a variation of only 1 dBi across the frequency range of 54 GHz to 74 GHz. The integration of ENZ lenses and mushroom beam-directors presents a unique and innovative approach to enhancing the performance of millimeter-wave antennas. The fabrication results show a great agreement with simulation results too.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Jamali, Saeedeh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Protein sequence analysis is arguably a challenging modern bioinformatics problem covering various applications such as disease research, precision medicine, and therapeutics. Given the emergence of sequencing technologies and the resulting large-scale databases, protein family classification is an open problem in bioinformatics. Recent advances in computer science have opened new gates to researchers in various scientific domains. Bioinformatics, as an intermediary research field, takes advantage of these advancements from conventional machine learning methods to large language models, and biostatistics. Utilized machine learning techniques for protein family classification, are dependent on domain experts to generate features which could be time-consuming and challenging. Deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in proteomics; however, their application is limited to the availability of massive data sets for training. Since the required data comes from experiments, it can be highly complex or incomplete. As an alternative, few-shot models can learn and generalize from a few observations. To address the mentioned limitations, in this research, we designed and implemented a deep few-shot network for protein family classification and our result showed outperformance to state-of-the-art baseline models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep network tailored for primary sequence family classification that can highly perform with a very limited number of observations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Apocryphal Additions to Old English Translations of Genesis</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jando-Saul, Ella</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis addresses the addition of apocryphal material to two translations of the Book of Genesis into Old English and argues that these additions requore us to rethink the meaning of fidelity to the original source in the context of Anglo-Saxon translations of scripture. The additions exist in both the Genesis poem from MS Junius 11 and the prose translation of Genesis found in a number of manuscripts, including the Illustrated Old English Hexateuch. Both works begin with accounts, in text or in illustration, of the fall of the angels. These accounts go beyond what can be understood from the exegesis of canonical scripture. They also both add apocryphal details surrounding the life of Enoch, seventh patriarch from Adam. These insertions serve to frame the Old Testament text in a Christian context. Both prose and verse texts use these apocryphal materials to bring out the themes of good and evil and gesture to the greater narrative that begins with Creation and end with Judgment. Paradoxically, then, the addition of apocryphal material helps guide a less learned reader in their understanding of the Book of Genesis and its position in relation to Christian doctrine. The texts thus have a different approach to the tension between "word for word" and "sense for sense" fidelity to the source, focusing instead on maximizing the accessibility of the text to an audience that may not ever be able to study the Latin original.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Classification of Breast Cancer Cytological Images using Vision Transformers</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>JebeliHajiAbadi, MohammadReza</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of Vision Transformers (ViT) and Swin Transformers for breast cancer classification, highlighting their advantages over traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in processing cytological images. Amid the critical need for better breast cancer diagnostics, these transformer-based models emerge as a promising solution, adept at capturing complex spatial and contextual data in medical images.

The research methodology involved collecting and preprocessing a dataset of cytological and histopathological breast cancer images. The performance of the vision transformers was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC, and compared against established CNN architectures. The results demonstrate that vision transformers excel at extracting complex patterns from images, significantly outperforming current methods. Specifically, the study reports a 3.06% improvement in classification accuracy over traditional approaches, achieving 95.01% accuracy on test sets and perfect accuracy in validation.

The thesis underscores the potential of ViT and Swin models to advance early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Their success in the study suggests a transformative shift towards utilizing advanced deep learning architectures in medical image analysis. This approach not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also offers a data-efficient solution to the challenges of breast cancer classification. The findings advocate for further exploration of transformer-based models, which could redefine the standards of computer-aided diagnosis and significantly impact the field of cancer classification.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Efficient Explainable AI And Adversarial Robustness using Formal Methods</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jemaa, Amira</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in critical applications, but their lack of transparency often hinders trust and reliability. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by making machine learning models more understandable and interpretable. Current XAI approaches, however, lack consistency or theoretical guarantees. Formal methods, which are rigorous mathematical reasoning tools, could play a significant role in overcoming these limitations by providing sound and consistent explanations for model decisions. This thesis builds upon an existing formal XAI tool, XReason, which uses logical reasoning to generate explanations for individual predictions. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, the tool is extended to support a powerful tree based model, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LighGBM), which offers improved scalability and performance for large datasets. Second, it introduces explanations at the class level, enabling the analysis of general patterns in model behavior across different prediction categories. This provides insights into the factors shaping model decisions for each class and helps identify biases or inconsistencies in predictions. Third, adversarial robustness is explored by integrating methods to generate and detect adversarial examples. These adversarial samples expose vulnerabilities in the model by identifying subtle input changes that lead to incorrect predictions. Detection mechanisms are then developed to identify such inputs, enhancing the model’s reliability. Experiments on a variety of datasets from different domains demonstrate that the extended framework produces consistent and robust explanations, both at the individual prediction level and across broader trends. By integrating formal methods, this work provides a practical formal XAI framework applicable to areas where trust in AI systems is essential.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Personalized Visual Dubbing through Virtual Dubber and Full Head Reenactment</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jeon, Bobae</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Visual dubbing aims to modify facial expressions to "lip-sync" a new audio track. While person-generic talking head generation methods have made significant progress in expressive lip synchronization across arbitrary identities, they usually lack person-specific details and fail to generate high-quality results. On the other hand, person-specific approaches enable realistic identity preservation and high lip-sync quality but require extensive training, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications.

Our method combines the strengths of both approaches to generate balanced results in lip synchronization and visual quality while achieving training efficiency. To this end, our pipeline incorporates a virtual dubber, a person-generic talking head, as an intermediate representation. This simplifies identity swapping, enhances efficiency, and improves both visual quality and expression accuracy.

Key innovations include full-head identity swapping and reenactment, eliminating artifacts such as the double chin effect while ensuring temporal stability. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior balance between lip-sync accuracy and realistic facial reenactment.

Furthermore, we validate the robustness of our method with experiments in challenging real-world scenarios, including tilted head poses and facial occlusions. Notably, our pipeline operates effectively with short video clips, emphasizing its efficiency and practicality.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Investigating orthogonal interactions between 20S proteasome subunits by humanizing assembly chaperones in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jeong, Homin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The proteasome is a large, multi-subunit protein complex essential for degrading unneeded, misfolded or damaged proteins in eukaryotic cells. Mutations in its subunits are linked to many human diseases. How these mutations affect proteasome function remains unclear, so scientists have begun developing a budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) model with a fully humanized proteasome to accommodate detailed study.
To date, up to 6 of 7 alpha subunits in the 20S core of the proteasome can be humanized together, all except the α5 subunit, preventing complete humanization of alpha ring in S. cerevisiae. This suggests that yeast chaperones responsible for assembling the 20S proteosome complex may be incompatible with some human subunits (e.g. α5). Thus, to achieve my aim of completely humanizing the alpha ring, I created a set of genetically engineered yeast strains expressing orthologous human chaperones and investigated whether they improved proteasome humanization in yeast.
Results show that human chaperones do not complement phenotypes associated with deleting their yeast orthologs, suggesting they may be incapable of yeast proteosome assembly. Moreover, negative genetic interactions observed between human chaperones and human α5 or β2 subunits suggest these subunits may disrupt yeast 20S assembly. Human chaperone expression failed to permit humanization of α5 in strains harboring partially humanized alpha rings, suggesting that incompatible interactions involving assembly chaperones are not likely responsible for incomplete alpha ring humanization in yeast.
In conclusion, expressing human chaperones in S. cerevisiae failed to overcome barriers preventing complete proteasome humanization, but provided several insights to direct future studies focused on developing this model to study proteasome related diseases.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Thermostat control strategies for thermal comfort and energy-efficient operation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jian, Li</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Thermal comfort standards, such as ASHRAE Standard 55, prescribe a thermal comfort zone based on operative temperature, which includes both dry-bulb temperature and mean radiant temperature in the calculation. However, the built environment, regulated by a dry-bulb temperature based thermostat, will quite often maintain a space outside of its thermal comfort zone. The problem is more pronounced in a space open to a large window surface when the influence of the mean radiant temperature is not considered. The objective of the research is to develop control strategies that can maintain the space within the thermal comfort zone and offer energy savings. 
The work is based on energy modeling and simulation of the five thermal zones (core, south, east, north, and west) of a prototypical small office building for four different climate zones (represented by Miami, San Diego, New York, and Montreal) under the influence of various window sizes (ranging from window-to-wall ratios of 10% to 80%). EnergyPlus software is used to simulate indoor environmental conditions and calculate the energy demand to maintain such conditions. Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model is used to estimate occupants’ thermal sensations in the space operated under the control of conventional dry-bulb thermostats. A performance indicator is developed to facilitate the calculation of new thermostat setpoints (and subsequent development of control strategies) that could ensure the space is maintained within the thermal comfort zone and operated with some energy savings for all occupied hours. 
	Simulation results reveal a monotonic correlation between window size and the number of hours outside of the thermal comfort zone. The proposed control strategies are not only able to maintain the space within the thermal comfort zone and offer energy savings but also can be implemented with no modification to existing HVAC equipment or building fabric.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>What makes emotional ads go viral?: The mediating role of emotional intensity and the moderating role of narrative transportation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jing, Lingyun</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study investigates the impact of negative emotional appeals in digital marketing, specifically focusing on how emotions of fear and sadness influence the intention to share. Viral marketing utilizes the immense influence of social media to help brand advertisements achieve faster and wider distribution. Previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of positive emotional ad appeals, or have compared the effects of positive versus negative ad appeals on consumer outcomes. Conversely, this study explores how different negative emotions (fear, sadness) differentially influence consumers' intentions to share. This study also explores the mediating role of emotional intensity and the moderating effect of narrative transportation. Through two experimental studies, the findings reveal that high arousal negative appeals (i.e., fear and high-intensity sadness) are more likely to increase sharing intentions among people who are either moderately or deeply engaged with the story in the advertisement, in contrast to low arousal negative appeals (i.e., low-intensity sadness) and positive emotional appeals (i.e., joy). The investigation provides new insight for digital marketing professionals to create compelling advertising content that encourages content sharing.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Johnson, Sydney</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Biomanufacturing uses engineered biological systems to produce valuable compounds from inexpensive materials like waste, reducing reliance on oil- and gas-based chemical production and promoting sustainable manufacturing. While many microbial species are used as hosts, non-conventional yeasts like Kluyveromyces marxianus have gained interest due to unique traits such as rapid growth, thermotolerance, and broad substrate utilization. Here, we investigated transcriptional networks in K. marxianus by engineering transcription factors (TFs) to enhance industrial stress tolerance. We compared two TF upregulation strategies: activation via fusion to viral activation domains (VPR and VP64) and overexpression via fusion to a strong promoter. Overexpression of the model TF KmGcn4p using the KmPDC1 promoter increased HIS3 expression 5-fold and significantly improved growth in the presence of the HIS3 inhibitor 3-AT. Transcriptomic analysis using Nanopore RNA-seq revealed that KmPDC1-driven overexpression of GCN4, HCM1, MSN2, and PDR1 produced differential gene expression across all three TF subclasses. Finally, to identify TFs directing stress tolerance, a high-throughput competition assay workflow was developed to screen barcoded TF libraries. In a library of 10 barcoded TFs, GCN4 and its haplotig allele (GCN4_hap) were found to be the “winner” TFs with increased frequencies of 0.7 and 1.8 (log2) under 70 mM of 3-AT. Future work will apply this pipeline to screen 291 overexpressed K. marxianus TFs under biomanufacturing-relevant stresses to identify TFs that can improve K. marxianus as an industrial bioprocessing strain.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Strategizing Crude Oil Market Dynamics: Using Deep Learning Predictive Models and the Influence of Parameter Optimization</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kachwaha, Shagun</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Keywords: Supply chain disruptions, Deep learning models, Forecasting, Bayesian Optimization, Oil Price Uncertainty</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Crude oil, originating from organic material deposited millions of years ago, serves as the raw material for products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, highlighting its crucial role in modern industry and daily life. Predicting crude oil prices is vital for supply chain managers making operational decisions such as purchasing, production, and transportation. This research aims to predict oil prices to reduce operational costs, increase profit, and enhance competitive advantage. We employed deep learning models to capture the complex, nonlinear characteristics of crude oil price dynamics, utilizing a hyperparameter optimization framework with Bayesian optimization (Optuna) for improved convergence, reduced overfitting, and higher accuracy. In a world shaped by technological breakthroughs, geopolitical intricacies, and economic pressures, precise prediction of oil prices is challenging but essential. Advanced machine learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) were utilized. This study used datasets including WTI and BRENT to explore neural network’s ability to understand complex market linkages. Three comparative metrics—RMSE, MAD, and MAPE—ensured result reliability and application across various domains. Forecasts were conducted across three time horizons: daily, weekly, and monthly, each crucial for different stakeholders such as day traders, logistical planners, and strategic decision-makers. Daily forecasts navigate immediate market volatility, weekly forecasts inform logistical and operational adjustments, and monthly forecasts align with long-term strategic planning.
Finally, we compared traditional statistical models with the best deep learning models for both Brent and WTI crude oil using RMSE, MAD, and MAPE to assess the robustness of the deep learning approaches.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Kadam, Bhushan Mahendra</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Tipping remains a crucial aspect of the service industry globally, serving as a major source of income for service workers and reinforcing social norms of rewarding good service. The intricate practice of tipping within the service industry is shaped by a confluence of economic, social, and psychological factors, deeply influencing both server and customer behaviours. Research on tipping dynamics shows that customers often face social pressures to tip regardless of service quality, while servers experience economic instability due to the variability of tips. My thesis explores tipping dynamics in the Canadian food service industry, through 12 semi-structured interviews and YouTube content analysis. By analysing the customer-server interaction and the socio-economic pressures surrounding tipping, my research uncovers how imposed service conditions affect the servers and customers individually, with a significant impact on their relationship. This research contributes to the literature by deepening the theoretical understanding of the impact of tipping on social, economic, and psychological dynamics within the Canadian service industry. For practitioners my research offers actionable insights for crafting equitable service policies that not only enhance customer satisfaction but also foster a more harmonious and rewarding environment for servers.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>On the Syntax-Morphology Divide: Towards a Unified Analysis of
Causatives. The Case of Hungarian and Japanese</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kalapos, Amber</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis argues for a unified syntactic analysis of causatives. Previous literature has taken contrasts between Hungarian and Japanese morphological causatives as evidence that Hungarian causatives are derived in the lexicon via arity operations, while their Japanese counterparts are derived in the syntax via Merge and Agree. It is shown that the contrasts between Hungarian and Japanese causatives can be accounted for within the syntax, without needing to posit a separate computational component in the lexicon. Specifically, I argue that the locus of variation has to do with the size of the complements taken by Hungarian and Japanese causatives. Following Pylkkänen (2008)’s causative typology, I assume that Hungarian causatives embed little-v (i.e. they are ‘verb selecting’ in Pylkkänen’s terminology), while Japanese causatives embed Voice (i.e. they are ‘Voice-selecting’). Furthermore, I demonstrate that the syntactic analysis I propose accommodates empirical evidence that cannot be accounted for under a lexicalist analysis.</etd_ms:description>

It is frequently assumed that cancer is more likely to affect those with weak bodies and unhealthy lifestyles, as well as older individuals. These and other incorrect assumptions about cancer significantly impact on the experience of a cancer diagnosis. On receiving an ALK-positive cancer diagnosis, I turned to the internet for further information. While some of the content that is available online is accurate, it is often low-resolution, and in some instances, factually incorrect or misleading. The quality of accessible information about cancer impacts on the lives of patients, medical professionals, and caregivers alike. From this understanding, three questions emerged from the study and personal experience: (1) Why is online information about health conditions so generic, and what do researchers acknowledge about the shortcomings of publicly accessible content? (2) What observations can I make by analyzing a handful of websites? (3) Can creating content/ story/ information through "thick description" using ethno-graphy help consolidate an understanding of ALK-positive?  

Having experienced the quality of accessible information and with literature review, it was evident that healthcare content needs to be relooked. As a patient, I reflected upon myself and reasoned a way of bringing the experience as research- creation. It is an autoethnography that maps various events in the journey of being a patient in the form of ethno-graphy. The narrative is not centered only around the condition but there are several aspects that are interconnected with each other. It is a cluster of coordination between various systems or groups of professionals who became a part of the day-to-day life to keep the disease monitored. Chapter 1 shows the life around me gradually transcending to a diagnosis that needed further investigation. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 are not in the scope of the thesis. These two chapters cover various systems coming together to put the condition into control. The thesis also breaks down the method of research-creation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effect of Immigration on Real Estate in Canada</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kalia, Prateek</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The number of immigrants in Canada has drastically increased in recent years due to
permissive government immigration policies that attract people from around the world
in search of a better life. This paper examines whether this surge in immigrants has
affected real estate prices and the rental market in one of Canada’s largest cities. The
study finds that major impacts on real estate prices stem from supply factors, such
as the number of houses built, and demand factors, such as changes in population
and income per capita. While the overall immigrant population does not significantly
affect house prices, the impact becomes evident when considering ethnic origin. This
suggests that immigration tends to cluster by ethnicity, leading to a rise in house prices
in certain areas, though this effect is not observed in rental markets.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis delves into the performance of balloon-type cross-laminated timber buildings. The study focuses on hybrid buildings with balloon-type cross-laminated timber shear walls and steel frames. The effects of mass and vertical geometric irregularities in hybrid buildings are evaluated using Modal Response Spectrum Analysis. The findings reveal that mass irregularities markedly influence inter-story drift, mainly when mass is incorporated at different levels, and that the location of mass addition is vital to the building's seismic response. The vertical geometric irregularity of the building impacts the seismic response uniquely in two orthogonal directions.  
Further, the study explores the lateral performance of unbonded post-tensioned balloon-type CLT shear walls. Traditional sensitivity analysis and machine learning models were employed to identify the critical parameters influencing the lateral and uplifting response of the unbonded post-tensioned balloon-type cross-laminated timber shear wall under lateral loading. Various machine learning algorithms were utilised to investigate the best performance model for predicting the critical parameters while applying Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to elucidate better the factors influencing lateral and uplifting responses. 
The thesis offers valuable perspectives on integrating advanced computational techniques with traditional structural engineering practices, fostering the development of resilient and sustainable building designs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Influencer marketing has become a valuable marketing communications channel for brands to
generate positive connections with consumers. Building on the success of their human
counterparts, a unique niche of pet influencers has emerged and provided brands with new social
media marketing opportunities. My thesis investigated whether, how, and why pet influencers
impact consumers’ responses to sponsored social media posts featuring them. Across one pre-test
and three studies, I investigated the effects of the perceived level of cuteness of a social media
influencer (i.e., pet influencer vs. human influencer) on consumers’ attitudes, behavioral
intentions, and purchase likelihood. Study 1 found no main effects of influencer type on
consumers’ responses, but revealed serial mediations through mood and perceived persuasion
intent, which closely and conceptually replicated in Studies 2a and 2b respectively. My thesis
provides theoretical contributions, avenues for future research, and managerial implications
related to the use of pet influencers in marketing communications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the public perception and acceptance of automated shuttle services for last-mile connectivity in Montreal. Through a comprehensive survey, the study examines key factors influencing acceptance of the autonomous shuttle, including experience, awareness, comfort and safety level, trust in technology, benefits and barriers, and potential integration into urban transportation systems. A survey of Montreal residents (n=52) reveals key insights into demographic trends and attitudes towards autonomous vehicles (AVs). Results indicate a moderate familiarity with AVs (38.6%) compared to the US (70.90%), UK (66%), and Australia (61%). Despite this, Montrealer’s expressed positive sentiments towards AVs (54%), slightly higher than the UK and US. Concerns about safety (49% very concerned), legal liability (47.10% very concerned), and data privacy (63.50% very concerned) were prominent. Comfort levels with autonomous technology varied, with 38.45% having heard of autonomous shuttles but only 13.46% having boarded one. Respondents showed preference for level 3 automation (56%) over higher levels. Concerns about interactions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and bikers were noted. Overall, Montreal residents are open to AVs but harbor significant concerns, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address safety, security, and privacy issues in deploying automated shuttle services effectively.

        <etd_ms:title>Do Children with Higher Levels of Sport Specialization Perform Fundamental Movement Skills Better than Children with Lower Specialization Scores?</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Karoutas Del Vecchio, Alexandra</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Introduction: To assess the degree of sport specialization of a children, there is the newly developed 4-point scale [24]. This tool has been used to observe the correlation between sport specialization levels and injury risk. The Child-Focused Injury Risk Screening Tool (ChildFIRST) is a process-based tool assessing 10 skills to evaluate movement competence of the lower extremity in children aged 8 to 12 years old. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between the participants’ level of sport specialization and their movement competence, scores they receive on the ChildFIRST. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 70 participants (34 hockey players and 36 figure skaters), 8 to 12 years old, took part in a survey assessing their sport specialization level and were evaluated using the ChildFIRST tool. We analyzed the data using correlations, One-Way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and descriptive statistics. Results: This study found that older athletes were more specialized and performed better on the ChildFIRST. However, it did not find a correlation between specialization level and ChildFIRST scores. When comparing the hockey to the figure skating group using non-parametric tests, we found that specialization levels and ChildFIRST scores are both significantly higher in the figure skating groups. Conclusion: These results suggests that in children aged 8 to 12 years old, there is no relationship between specializing early and movement competence in this study. They do however demonstrate that the figure skating group, across all ages, are more specialized and better at movement competence (performing better on lower limb motion and alignment movements).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Spectral Cloth: Textile Readings of Queer Identity</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kartal, Olive Zeynep</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis rethinks queer reading as textile reading as it traces instances where queerness appears as represented through clothes, becoming textile. After demonstrating through historical examples how clothes create meaning and can be subverted in their wearing, the thesis turns to cinema to argue that queer representation appears on screen as a textile coding. The thesis enacts a survey of queer textile representation in cinema’s history, from Morocco (1930) to Queen Christina (1933), Rebecca (1940), and All About Eve (1950), to argue that queerness and sexuality are partly textile constructions. While elevating textiles from their designation to costume and mise-en-scene to a category of signification of their own, the thesis conceives of textiles as signifying spectrally, through coded representation. The third chapter synthesizes textility and spectrality, to question how queer representation, and representation in general, manifests. The thesis offers a textile approach to queer theory: one that synthesizes essentialism and constructionism through the queer visions conjured by textiles. Through an understanding of “style” as a defiant queer practice that can enact change upon the world, the thesis offers new ways of thinking about our identities and their textile constructions. It champions a reading of textiles for meaning, constructing the method of queer textile reading, that it then applies to later films such as Fried Green Tomatoes (1991), Personal Shopper (2016), and Barbie (2023), to show the method’s utility throughout film history and today. What also becomes visible in these queer textile readings is the textility and spectrality of the film medium itself: its textile-like qualities, but also its ability to make ghosts appear through the cloth.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Personalized Class Incremental Context-Aware Food Classification for Food Intake Monitoring</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kazemi Tehrani, Hassan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Accurate food intake monitoring is essential for maintaining a healthy diet and preventing nutrition-related diseases. Traditional food classification models struggle with the diverse range of foods across cultures and the continuous introduction of new food types due to relying on fixed-sized datasets. Moreover, studies show that people consume only a small range of foods across the existing ones. These limitations necessitate the model to adapt itself as new classes appear. Additionally, the model needs to pay more attention to certain food classes. 
While existing class-incremental models have low accuracy for the new classes and lack personalization, this work introduces a personalized, class-incremental food classification model designed to address these challenges and enhance food intake monitoring systems. Our approach dynamically adapts to new real-world food classes, maintaining accuracy for both new and existing classes through personalization. The model prioritizes foods based on individuals eating habits by considering meal frequencies, times, and locations.
We employ a modified dynamic support network (DSN), the personalized dynamic support network (PDSN), to handle new food classes and propose a comprehensive framework integrating this model into a food intake monitoring system. The system analyzes meal images, estimates food weight with a smart scale, calculates macro-nutrient content, and creates a dietary profile via a mobile app. Experimental evaluations on the personalized datasets FOOD101-Personal and VIPER-FoodNet-Personal (VFN-Personal) demonstrate the model's effectiveness in improving classification accuracy, addressing the limitations of conventional and class-incremental food classification models.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Environmentally friendly alternatives to MoS2-Lead based solid
lubricants and anti-icing for aerospace applications: A
combined experimental-computational study</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kazemimanesh, Anahit</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>To address two important challenges in aerospace industry which are 1) ice growth and 2)
friction and wear, two environmentally friendly materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
and antifreeze protein (AFP) were pursued in this study. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-based
solid lubricants commonly doped with lead (Pb) are widely used in industry. However, due to the
toxic nature of Pb, there is an interest in replacing it with more environmentally friendly material.
hBN is a potential alternative with a lamellar structure and a great lubricity property. Therefore,
MoS2-based solid lubricant containing five different concentrations of hBN (3.8, 5.7, 7.5, 9.5, and
11.5 wt.%) were applied on five 304L stainless steel substrates using spray bonding method to
explore their tribological performance. Reciprocating tribology tests were performed using a ball-
on-flat tribometer with alumina (Al2O3) counterface in atmospheric conditions. To characterize the
wear tracks, ex-situ analysis such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy,
and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used. The MoS2-based solid lubricant with 5.7% hBN
revealed acceptable tribological performance. Additionally, to study the amount of ice growth on
a surface, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for three systems;
system A contains 3-layer hBN nanosheet, a layer of ice, and spruce budworm antifreeze protein
(sbwAFP), system B consist of 3-layer hBN nanosheet, an ice layer, and a non-antifreeze protein
found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MfpA), and system C includes 3-layer hBN nanosheet and
an ice layer without any biomolecules. The presence of sbwAFP and hBN presented less formation
of hexagonal ice in system A and C compared to system B.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>By drawing a line between seemingly two disparate phenomena, the introduction of story elements into videogames by Japanese developers working during the latter part of the last century and the current efforts of Indigenous game developers to tell stories with videogames in the current one, this thesis links the productive practices of two different groups: independent game developers in Japan, and high school students on the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve outside Montreal. Practices are placed in the broader context of storied creators working during the ‘Golden Era’ of the Japanese games industry in the 1980’s, and North American developers working, with the help of Indigenous consultants, to develop AAA games featuring Indigenous content in the 2010’s. 

By first looking at the formal innovations in storytelling that the Japanese games industry brought to the medium and then, through analysis of a series of interviews with independent game developers working in that same industry, this thesis critically considers how independent developers in Japan develop games. Finally, by reviewing three of examples of Indigenous game development in North America, this thesis discusses how the practices might be transferable.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Atomistic Simulations of Next-generation Durable Aerospace Materials: A Comparison between Nickel and Cobalt Oxides</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kermanian, Niki</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Nickel and cobalt-based superalloys are extensively used in various industrial turbomachinery. In the aerospace industry, these alloys are employed as outstanding materials and quality coatings, exhibiting exceptional mechanical performance within the severe environments of gas turbine engines. The formation of nickel oxide (NiO) and cobalt oxide (CoO) during sliding contributes to lubricious tribofilms reducing friction and wear rates at contact interfaces. Despite their similar rock salt crystal structure with ionic bonds, NiO and CoO display distinct behaviors in mechanical and tribological terms. Experimental studies reveal the superior performance of the third body formed on Co-based alloys compared to that of Ni-based materials. However, computational investigations at the nanoscale are essential to analyze the different behaviors of these metal oxides. 

In this dissertation, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to evaluate the mechanical behavior of NiO and CoO under uniaxial compressive and tensile loading at room temperature (300 K). The combination of the Second Nearest-Neighbor Modified Embedded-Atom Method and the Charge Equilibration method (2NNMEAM+Qeq) potential was employed for each oxide to accurately present the interatomic forces and interactions within the ionic crystal structure. The compressive and tensile engineering stress-strain findings of the present study highlight the remarkable ability of CoO for high-strength applications where structural stability and resistance to permanent deformation are critical. CoO exhibits stronger performance compared to NiO under higher stress conditions. The use of durable materials and excellent oxide-based coatings could significantly enhance equipment efficiency, leading to fuel consumption reductions in aerospace applications.</etd_ms:description>

Elaheh Khademi

	This comprehensive literature review was undertaken to advance our understanding of ways that technology can be a transformative force in the lives of older adults. By critically examining existing research, it summarises the current state of knowledge and pinpoints critical gaps in the field, offering some insights for both practical applications and future investigations. This review also highlights the significant potential of technology in enhancing social interactions and mitigating the pervasive issue of isolation among older adults. Leveraging technology to create meaningful social connections can substantially improve their quality of life, a prospect that deserves concerted attention and effort. 	Finally, this review encourages a continued commitment to research in areas that remain unexplored or underexplored within the current literature. By addressing these gaps, we can refine our understanding of how technology can better serve older adults and contribute to their overall well-being. This literature review not only provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of knowledge but also offers a roadmap for action. The recommendations put forth here, grounded in the identified gaps and opportunities within the existing literature, collectively aim to enhance the quality of life for older adults and facilitate their successful integration into the digital age.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Assessing the Robustness of HAR Deep Learning Models against Variability</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Khaked, Azhar Ali</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Deep learning (DL) Human Activity Recognition (HAR) models using wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors have shown great promise in applications like continuous healthcare monitoring and early disease prediction. However, most DL HAR models remain untested in real-world scenarios laden with variabilities; rather, they are trained and tested on constrained and closely curated HAR datasets that assume an ideal setting. This thesis explains the effects of real-world variabilities like subject, device, position, and orientation on the performance of DL HAR models. Due to the inability of existing datasets to isolate variabilities, we collect our own, the HARVAR dataset. We isolated the effect of different variabilities and provided a nuanced understanding of how each affects DL HAR models' performance. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) was used to quantify shifts in data distribution due to each isolated variability and drew a relationship between the drop in performance and the change in data distribution. The REALDISP dataset was used to perform a case study to understand the effects of compounded and unisolated variabilities in the real world. This study found that different variabilities have varying effects on the DL HAR model performance, from insignificant to detrimental. We showed a negative correlation between the MMD and the performance drop of the DL HAR models in the results drawn from both HARVAR and REALDISP datasets. The study emphasizes the need for more robust models and the development of pre-processing methodologies to optimize the IMU data for training robust DL HAR models.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>TRANSFORMING PARKING FACILITIES TO ACCOMMODATE ELECTRIC VEHICLES: A CAPACITATED MULTI-FACILITY LOCATION PROBLEM APPROACH.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Khalili, Kimia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study addresses the limitations of Electric Vehicles Charging Stations (EVCS) in Montréal, Québec. Momentum, the growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is projected to accelerate substantially. However, this growth is hindered by limited EVCS, particularly in shopping center settings where high cost and spatial limitations pose significant challenges. This study addresses these gaps by proposing an optimization model to support cost-effective EVCS placement.
The problem employs Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), categorizing it as a capacitated multi-facility location allocation challenge. This approach is designed to minimize the total lifecycle costs for property owners, including costs related to equipment, electrical system equipment, operational and maintenance, fixed costs, and dismantling expenses.
The optimization process involves determining the desired number of ports in the parking, based on the available estimation of the EV growth as a first step. Afterward, determining parking blocks based on the parking size to allocate the different types of ports into them. Then, various port type combinations, are distributed into all the generated block combinations. The proposed formulation is a Life Cycle Cost (LCC)-Based optimization designed to achieve minimum costs. The solution introduces a combinatorial optimization algorithm that combines dynamic programming and brute-force search to ensure all potential configurations are considered.
In conclusion, this study provides a framework for shopping center owners to adapt their parking facilities to EVs. The proposed cost formulation provides a financially sustainable solution for EVCS placements. Through this approach, this study offers a practical method to enhance EV infrastructure within commercial indoor parking environments, balancing financial and logistical considerations</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Robust Graph Convolutional Networks for Adversarial Resilience and Anomaly Detection</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Khan, MD Shakib</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Adversarial attacks and anomaly detection are closely related, both focusing on identifying irregularities that deviate from normal patterns across various data types, including graph-structured data. Adversarial attacks on graphs pose a significant threat to graph convolutional networks (GCNs), involving intentional manipulation of graph data to mislead GCNs into making incorrect predictions. Standard GCNs, while powerful, often exhibit vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks that can significantly degrade their performance in anomaly detection tasks. These networks also have inherent limitations, such as their inability to effectively consider higher-order neighbour information, restricting their capacity to capture the full context of a node within the graph. To address these challenges, this thesis introduces an iterative graph filtering framework, which builds upon the graph signal processing concept of iteratively solving graph filtering using the fixed-point iterative method. The proposed framework is designed to enhance resilience against adversarial attacks while improving anomaly detection capabilities. The thesis makes two main contributions: a flexible spectral modulation filter that selectively attenuates high-frequency components of graph signals; and a robust aggregation mechanism that efficiently captures information from higher-order node neighbors, expanding the networks receptive field without increasing computational complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results demonstrate significant improvements in anomaly detection accuracy and adversarial robustness compared to strong baselines. This highlights the potential of the proposed framework for reliable graph-based downstream tasks, paving the way for robust GCNs that can handle the complexities and adversarial threats inherent in real-world applications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Displacement and Stress Computation in Dual-Horizon State-Based 
Peridynamics</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Khoshrou, Ali</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Numerous research endeavors have delved into the realm of multi horizon peridynamics frameworks and their connection to the interplay between peridynamic force densities and stress tensors in the field of continuum mechanics. This study introduces an enhanced iteration of the dual horizon peridynamic (DH-PD) model, merging established multi-horizon peridynamic frameworks with equations that specifically establish stress components using peridynamic forces. This pioneering model offers a method to analyze stress within a 2D framework. The new formulation allows for choosing two horizons and concentration of more material points in high-stress areas. By using this dual horizon idea, the model computes faster by focusing on  areas of interest while providing accurate results in less crucial areas. The peridynamics equations  are solved using a direct integration method. The efficiency of the model is assessed by benchmark problem tests involving a 2D steel plate  containing a central hole under uniform tension. The obtained solution is rigorously compared  with finite element solutions. This study demonstrates that the extended DH-PD model is capable  of computing stress and displacement fields, regardless of whether they are near high-stress concentration zones or in distant areas of the simulated 2D setup. The model showcases its ability to accurately capture the intricate behavior of stress and deformation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Working in the “New Normal”: Exploring the Link Between Hybrid Work and Need Fulfillment</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kisil, Nickolas</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study investigated the mechanisms through which daily work modalities (i.e., work-from- home (WFH) and office-based work) influence daily fulfillment of employees’ basic psychological needs. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), I hypothesized that daily fulfillment of the needs for autonomy and competence is higher on days when an employee is in the WFH modality than on days when they are in the office modality, and that daily fulfillment of the need for relatedness is higher for days in the office modality than for days in the WFH modality. I further hypothesized that perceived monitoring, perceived locational autonomy, workplace interruptions, and social interactions are mechanisms through which these effects occur. I also proposed that shared modality prevalence (the extent to which colleagues share the same daily work modality) moderates the effects of daily work modality on these mechanisms. A longitudinal daily diary methodology was employed to capture within-person variability and to examine how differences in work modalities affect need satisfaction at the within-individual level. Survey data were collected from 142 participants over five workdays (N = 655 observations). A multilevel modeling approach was used to test hypotheses, accounting for both within-person and between-person variability. In line with my hypotheses, I found that the WFH modality was associated with enhanced fulfillment of the need for autonomy, mediated by reduced perceived monitoring and increased perceived locational autonomy. I also found that the office modality was associated with enhanced fulfillment of the need for relatedness, mediated by positive social interactions. In contrast to my hypotheses, no significant effects of work modality on fulfillment of the need for competence were found. This research advances the application of SDT to hybrid work environments, contributing to the literature on the impact of daily work modalities on psychological need satisfaction. It also establishes a foundation for future studies to investigate the nuanced effects of hybrid work arrangements on employee motivation. The practical implications of these findings are noteworthy. Organizations can enhance employee motivation by offering flexibility in work location and minimizing surveillance practices, thereby fostering a sense of autonomy. A balanced hybrid work model that combines flexible WFH options with coordinated, mandatory in-office days is recommended. This approach ensures that employees can enjoy the autonomy benefits of working from home while still reaping the social and relational advantages of in-person interactions, thereby optimizing both individual well-being and organizational cohesion.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Paula Rego (b. 1935) is a Portuguese-British artist whose work has been significantly informed by histories of feminism. Her responsive and reactive work often takes direct inspiration from historic events. In her 2004 series of pastels titled Possession I-VII, Rego adapts photographs commissioned by Jean-Martin Charcot of patients at the Salpêtrière Hospital, positioning her model, Lila Nunes, on an analytic couch. In doing so, Rego utilises the aesthetics and history of psychoanalysis in a careful re-adaptation, allowing us to reconsider what it is to depict a subject in this way. This thesis examines the Charcot photographs, as well as the depictions of Dora by Hélène Cixous and Sigmund Freud as means to trace the development and the changing perceptions of “the hysteric” or“madwoman”. By considering the history of this figure, her representations, and the ways she has been treated through the nineteenth to twenty-first centuries, I aim to shed new light on how this history effects the way we think about women’s pain, agency, emotions, subjectivity, sexuality, and ways in which they take up space in our own contemporary society.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The aviation industry explores innovative aircraft technologies and concepts aiming to reduce its emissions and meet environmental targets. The advanced technologies result in high complexity in aircraft systems, necessitating novel system architecting and safety assessment methods. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) presents a promising approach, offering more efficient systems development than document-centric methods. At the same time, safety assessment is an integral part of the system development process and can also benefit from a model-based approach. Model-Based Safety Assessment (MBSA) emerges to enable the analysis of the system architecture from a safety perspective and automate segments of the process, and by doing so, it improves efficiency by reducing development time and errors. The objectives of this thesis are to integrate MBSE and MBSA to construct a system model with an architecture specification that can help build safety models for fault tree analysis (FTA). This thesis focuses on the transition from system to safety models and explores various methods to enhance architecture specification in support of MBSA. The approach presented in this thesis utilizes the Capella workbench and extends the logical architecture levels of the Architecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach (ARCADIA) to represent the system architecture at the appropriate level of granularity to support MBSA. The presented methodology involves enriching a system specification model by integrating safety properties into Capella elements with the help of the property values management tools (PVMT). The flap system is selected as a test case, and a system model of the flap control and actuation system is developed and used to construct safety models in the AltaRica 3.0 language. Specific failure scenarios are introduced by adding observers to the safety models, enabling FTA with AltaRica 3.0. The minimal cutsets and failure rates of the FTA are examined to validate the results of the safety analysis, ensuring the transition between the system and the safety model is correct. Overall, the presented thesis helps to improve coherence and collaboration between system and safety engineers designing complex systems, such as advanced flight control system architectures.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The persistent gender gap in Software Engineering (SE) and related software development fields necessitates a thorough examination to expose the root causes and advance women’s engagement in technological innovation. This disparity presents both societal and technical challenges, perpetuating implicit gender biases in technology due to the limited representation of women. Online forums provide insight into women’s experiences with sexism in technical environments, but the unstructured nature of this data complicates the extraction of such specific instances. Our research aims to address this issue by analyzing online narratives from women software developers illustrating their experiences with sexism in technical teams. We initiate this study by constructing a taxonomy to identify various forms of sexism. Subsequently, we apply conventional data extraction techniques, such as static keyword-matching, and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including semantic similarity, to identify sexist experiences in the online dataset. Lastly, we evaluate the AI model’s effectiveness with Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) experts to ensure alignment with nuanced human understandings of sexism. Our results reveal the development of a taxonomy encompassing four distinct classes of sexism, supported by definitions, anchor examples, and lexicons. We observe that while semantic similarity techniques are proficient in extracting narratives of sexist experiences, the model encounters difficulties in accurate classification. Furthermore, our results highlight the intricate challenges of trying to align AI systems with human interpretations of sexism as defined in our taxonomy. Additionally, our findings reveal three previously overlooked instances of sexism. Based on our outcomes, we propose a code of conduct for practitioners to mitigate sexism within technical teams, enhancing women’s participation in SE and technological innovation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Self-Disclosure, Childhood, Adolescence, Peer Conflict, Parenting, Parent-Child Relationships, Hypothetical Vignettes, Maternal Responses, Disclosure Patterns</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examined children’s anticipated disclosure to parents regarding hypothetical situations of being harmed and harming a friend, along with their descriptions and evaluations of expected maternal responses. A sample of 196 children (92 boys, 104 girls) across three age groups (Mages = 8.57, 12.47, 17.58 years, respectively) responded to questions following two hypothetical conflict scenarios in which they were described as harming or being harmed by a friend (order counterbalanced). The first research aim was to examine whether children were more likely to disclose being harmed than harming a friend. Findings revealed that children were significantly more likely to disclose when they had been harmed. The second aim examined children’s expectations of maternal responses. Children expected more supportive responses and fewer negative judgments from their mothers when they had been harmed. The third aim explored whether children found maternal responses equally helpful across both events. Contrary to our expectations, children perceived their mothers’ responses as more helpful when they had harmed a friend. Lastly, the fourth aim examined how perceptions of maternal helpfulness were associated with children’s likelihood to disclose future experiences of harm. Children who perceived their mothers’ responses as more helpful were more likely to anticipate disclosing future experiences of harm. Children’s age and gender moderated some of these findings, and overall relationship quality also contributed uniquely to predicting disclosure patterns. Our study suggests disclosure of peer conflict and parent-child communication are fostered by a supportive, nonjudgmental environment in the context of high-quality, trusting relationships.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Truncated host-defense peptide derived from chicken angiogenin 4 (mChAng-4, c-(CRFKFRIVIC)) is a membrane active peptide displaying antibacterial properties. The structural properties of mChAng-4 are related to its function and aggregation properties. The cyclic nature of mChAng-4 makes its structure more constrained and stable compared to its linear analog. We study the structure and dynamics of single mChAng-4 peptides in solution as well as multi-chain mChAng-4 systems comprising eight peptides to investigate their aggregation. To investigate the effect of hydrophobicity on the structure, we study the native mChAng-4 (c-(CRFKFRIVIC)) and a valine substituted analog (c-(CRFKFRVVVC)). We compare the L and D configurations of the peptides as D-peptides are known to be more stable in a biological context due to a lack of D-specific peptidases. We compare the inverted sequence in L and D form (c-(CIVIRFKFRC)) to address differences between L and D enantiomers. An alanine scan revealed which residues were essential toward folding. We increase the rigidity of the peptide by replacing the disulfide linkage with an amide bridge. The analysis of the 500 μs ensemble of single peptide simulations shows that single peptides in solution display varying degrees of β sheet formation. Oligomerization was investigated in a 36 μs ensemble of the native, double valine mutant, linear, Dab, Dap, and native systems. The analysis of the 36 μs ensemble of aggregation systems suggested the linear, Dab, and Dap were more likely to aggregate in solution, but further analysis is needed to draw conclusions about the oligomerization states.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Kosik, Brandon</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Actovegin is a deproteinated calf blood extract that has been used clinically for over 60 years to treat a wide range of conditions. The drug is thought to exert its therapeutic benefits by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and cell metabolism. It is postulated that Actovegin has insulin-like properties and can increase glucose uptake in the cell. Due to its proposed mechanism of action, Actovegin has also been speculated as an aerobic performance enhancing drug and few studies have been sought out to confirm this speculation. In addition, the effects of this drug on mitochondrial respiration have only been investigated in skeletal muscle and liver tissue through an acute administration protocol. 

This thesis explores the effects of Actovegin from a functional and mechanistic perspective. The objectives were to determine if non-acute Actovegin injections every 2nd day for 14 days can increase aerobic exercise capacity and mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue in trained and sedentary mice versus equivalent groups receiving a placebo. Effects on blood glucose and body mass were also investigated. Using an aerobic exercise capacity test and high-resolution respirometry, the data revealed that Actovegin injections over a two-week period: (1) increased aerobic exercise capacity (2) increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, (3) did not have a significant effect on cardiac mitochondrial respiration. These results suggest that non-acute Actovegin injections may enhance aerobic exercise performance and reduce the heart’s need to increase contractile capacity in a high-intensity exercise setting.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The Lines-of-Defense model postulates that older adults should engage in important health goals and behaviours for as long as possible and adjust them downwardly only when they become impossible to pursue. This process is thought to be supported by goal engagement and self-protective control strategies. We tested this model in a 4-year longitudinal study of 236 older adults by predicting the maintenance of physical activity using accelerometers. We hypothesized that older adults would exert shifts from more strenuous (e.g., vigorous and moderate intensity) to less strenuous (e.g., light intensity) physical activity over time. In addition, we expected that these processes would be supported by the use of health-specific control strategies. Multilevel modeling revealed that older adults experienced declines in moderate and vigorous physical activity but increases in light physical activity. Health engagement predicted an accelerated increase in light physical activity, and exerted substantial, but longitudinally decreasing, benefits for moderate physical activity. Health-related self-protection, by contrast, predicted the maintenance of vigorous physical activity over time. These results support the Lines-of-Defense model by demonstrating that control strategies can predict the maintenance of older adults’ physical activity levels.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>"Ji zoongde’eyaang – To Have A Strong Heart” is an Indigenous/Anishnaabe research creation project which illuminates an arts-based process. This thesis explores a framework that embraces an inter-generational tradition of expressing embodied experiences—memories, losses, and reclamation between Anishnaabe artist Lara Kramer and her mother Ida Baptiste. The purpose of this research is to explore the ways in which the creative process facilitates embodied knowledge and contributes to a process of inter-generational healing. This exploration takes place in documenting the use of auto-ethnography, drawing from mother/daughter intergenerational stories and life experiences and the transmission of this knowledge through the Anishinaabemowin language and the creation of blankets as symbols of love, care, warmth and mothering. Furthermore, I describe the creative process of blanket making, working with the historical artifact of trade blankets, together with bias tape and tin jingles, and their connection to Anishinaabemowin history and language transmission. I examine the thread of “strong heartedness” that is woven through the process, and the blankets, in a spirit of relationality, cultural connection and survivance.

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines the potential for environmental animated media to be used as an informal educational tool for children. Through an examination of key animated works and their cultural contexts, I analyze the shifting ideologies within children's environmental media and investigate how animated films contribute to shaping children's perceptions of environmental issues and their agency in addressing them. Through studying the animation, production history and didactic storytelling techniques of Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1991), Ferngully: The Last Rainforest (1992), WALL-E (2008) and The Lorax (2012), I explore how animated media has historically failed to create meaningful environmental discourse. In analyzing the spatial and non-didactic storytelling of the 2019 film, Weathering With You (2019), I argue that the film's non-didactic and vernacular (familiar, of the people) storytelling provides space for the exploration of alternative environmental education, through map-based and site-specific learning.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This research examines the impact of CourseFlow, a cloud-based educational tool, in the program revision process at the Physiotherapy Technology program at Dawson College in Montreal, Canada. Through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders involved in program revision, the research looks at how CourseFlow supports practitioners in improving their own professional practices, fostering collaboration, and aligning course content with program outcomes, overall improving curriculum mapping and program revision processes. The research also explores how CourseFlow compares to other tools commonly used in program revisions, highlighting both its advantages and disadvantages. Some of the findings highlight that while CourseFlow enhances communication, facilitates more meaningful discussions, and promotes reflective practices within the program revision process, at the same time, it has limited editing capabilities, experiences difficulties with content migration, and provides for a steep learning curve for new users. Recommendations for improving CourseFlow include refining its visual interface, enhancing collaboration features, and enabling more effective side-by-side course comparisons. These improvements aim to further optimize CourseFlow for broader adoption and use. Suggestions for future studies outlined in this research include revisiting the original research design post-pandemic and utilizing the unused data collected during this study.</etd_ms:description>

Photoplethysmography using Deep Learning in Clinical
Setting: Critical Survey and Solutions</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>LaBerge, François</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Current solutions for blood pressure monitoring can be classified as invasive or non-invasive,
both with drawbacks. Invasive blood pressure monitoring can lead to complications. Non-invasive
blood pressure monitoring is intermittent which leads to missed episodes of hypertension and hy-
potension, also leading to complications. The state of the art for blood pressure monitoring through
machine learning methods usually requires personalization, which is prohibitive in a clinical appli-
cation. These proposed methods are generally not evaluated for clinical application. Datasets are
usually split randomly, while a patient-wise split is required.
We first start by performing a survey of the literature to find candidate models for evaluation.
These models are reproduced for evaluation alongside our proposed models. Popular input modal-
ities from the literature are also reproduced with our proposed input modality. All combinations of
models and input modalities are then evaluated against a patient-wise and random split. We perform
a learning curve analysis to estimate how much data would be required to pass the AAMI standard.
The performance results establish that no model can provide calibration-free, non-invasive blood
pressure monitoring using a single PPG site. The performance metrics show that our models and
input modalities outperform the state of the art for random and patient-wise splits. Comparison
against the models demonstrates that model complexity is insufficient to achieve better performance
and that better preprocessing is a more efficient way to improve performance. The learning-curve
analysis estimates that additional data could help achieve a model that passes the AAMI standard.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Reading Robots, Making Human: An Examination of Consciousness, Agency, and Programmed Entities in Ex Machina, BioShock, and Soma</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lacarra Ramirez, Fabrizio</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis uses the analogy of human consciousness as a computer program and its reversal, computer program as human consciousness, as bases for examining the consciousness and moral capacity of programmed entities depicted in popular media. An understanding of the term ‘program’ as it relates to the analogy plays a crucial role in exploring how modern media depictions fit into the analogous history.

My argument is explored through depictions of the analogy found in three major texts. Beginning with Alex Garland’s film Ex Machina, I frame my argument through the film’s interventions with established ideas of consciousness and agency, emphasizing Cartesian mind-body dualism. Following, I introduce two games, Irrational Games’ BioShock and Frictional Games’ Soma, that provide their own interventions to these ideas, introducing an additional variable to the discussion of agency through ludonarrative dissonance. 

Using these texts, I argue in favor of moral patiency and agency as indicators of consciousness in both human and artificial subjects. Ex Machina engages with this argument by presenting how moral capacity alters a subject’s quest for freedom. BioShock adds to this argument by having the player experience the protagonist’s inconsistent agency, inspiring them to help the character break from their programming and regain complete control as an agent. Soma reinforces the argument by depicting the quest for freedom as a relentless struggle for agency, rewarding its protagonist with a life in paradise thereafter. These deliberate interrogations of the human-machine distinction invites the audience to embrace programmed entities as moral patients.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The Internet of Things (IoT) and the number of deployed IoT devices are growing exponentially nowadays. These devices play pivotal roles in diverse domains, e.g., smart homes. Given their constrained processing and memory capacities, IoT devices communicate with one another through specialized protocols.
The two main IoT communication protocols are the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). By March 1, 2023, there were 35 public libraries of CoAP and 40 of MQTT. These libraries have different characteristics, including levels of completeness and runtime performances.
Because of diverse requirements in different domains, the same protocol/library does not apply to any applications. Consequently, developers must select a library (e.g., Californium, java-coap, Paho MQTT, or HiveMQ MQTT Client) but they do not have access to comprehensive and clear comparisons of the API and performance of these protocols and their implementations, impeding their ability to make informed choices.
In this thesis, we implement multiple IoT scenarios using the CoAP and MQTT protocols and several of their implementation libraries. We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis based on API and performance metrics, including static metrics, packet sizes, and runtime performance.
We thus provide developers with evidence to choose between CoAP and MQTT protocols and their libraries. In future work, we will expand this work to include other IoT protocols and libraries, more scenarios and metrics.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Mask and the Veil: Industrial Carnivals and the Theatrics of Social Control in 19th century St. Louis</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lalonde, Benjamin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis links the Veiled Prophet Society, a covert organization formed in 1878 by St. Louis' financial elite in response to the Great Strike of 1877, to the discursive transformation of procession into a “top-down” modality of power. Depicted in the Missouri Republican with a rifle and a bright pointed hood, the Veiled Prophet presaged the Ku Klux Klan’s later iconography, suggesting an intentional message of racial control. Accordingly, the organization’s procession aimed to indoctrinate Black and low-income communities, promoting the maxims of a burgeoning free market economy at a time of unparalleled economic disparity. This thesis thus situates the Veiled Prophet Society within a broader historical context, tracing its roots to European folk traditions like Charivari while examining its links to other American fraternal organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan and Krewes of Mardi Gras. By appropriating and transmuting carnivalesque folk forms into a vehicle for ideological transmission, the Veiled Prophet Society sought to reinforce racial boundaries and divide the working class amid economic unrest. The thesis draws on Cedric J. Robinson's concept of "racial capitalism" and Dubois’ “counter revolution of property” to reveal how market concerns reshaped racial constructs. Additionally, my research addresses the dual nature of secrecy and spectacle in right- wing organizations. While early scholarship viewed Klan secrecy as a necessary limitation, more recent studies suggest it functioned to attract new members and propagate ideology. This thesis advances the understanding of how "top-down" processional forms, like those of the Veiled Prophet Society, exploited the duality of secrecy and spectacle to control social narratives and maintain economic dominance, infusing processional traditions with a distinct panoptic quality.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>MEASURING IMPROPER TOKEN
INVALIDATION IN REAL-WORLD WEB
LOGINS</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lamisa, Kazi Farhat</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, we examine token invalidation flaws in real-world web applications.
While previous research has focused on cookie invalidation upon user logout, we investigate
the issue by examining token-based authorization in various contexts (e.g., user logout,
user verification, password recovery). Specifically, we focus on JSONWeb Tokens (JWTs)
to look for invalidation flaws, as JWTs are stateless and require web servers to implement
a separate invalidation mechanism for instant invalidation. To audit invalidation flaws, we
conduct a large-scale study on the top 1 million websites from Google’s Chrome User Experience
Report (CrUX). We develop an automated tool, LoginPlus that handles tasks such
as user registration, login and password recovery. Utilizing LoginPlus, first we identify
JWTs used to fetch resources from a web server while the user is authenticated and determine
whether these tokens are invalidated upon user logout. LoginPlus also handles all
emails sent during account creation and password recovery, identifying whether tokens included
in URLs sent to users for email verification or password recovery are invalidated
after a single use, checking if these URLs remain reusable over time. Finally, we evaluate
whether the websites invalidate all previously active sessions after a user resets their
password through the password recovery mechanism (e.g., ‘forgot password’).
Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of invalidation issues
in token-based authorization schemes across real-world websites and reveals several
significant findings regarding token invalidation mechanisms in web authorization. Firstly, 85% of the websites using JWTs for authorization do not implement an explicit invalidation
mechanism upon user logout. Additionally, 2.67% of websites log users in into the
system via verification URLs directly, and 48% of these sites do not invalidate the tokens
in the verification URLs even after 24 hours. Furthermore, 13.8% of websites that allow
password recovery through email URLs do not invalidate the tokens after they have been
used once. Lastly, 54% of the websites where we successfully reset a password do not
invalidate previously active sessions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The main purpose of this paper is to examine the phenomenon of graffiti in the urban environment in relation to urban design and architectural decisions. This research creation  hopes to shed light on areas of the city that require a more insightful evaluation prior to the consideration and adaptation as pre design research for future urban design projects. Post occupancy evaluation at the scope of a city can benefit from a new metric, one that has always been dismissed as irrelevant yet may have a trend that can help future evaluations or propositions of urban proposals. An emphasis on transdisciplinary research using autographic visualization to extract intersubjective data seeks to ameliorate future projects. Using a phenomenological inquiry perspective to navigate the results of qualitative methodologies results in recommendations for the future of our cities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effects of Exogenous Cardiolipin on Skeletal Muscle, Aerobic Exercise and Anxiety-Related Behaviour</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Laplante, Amanda</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Cardiolipin; vastus lateralis; running capacity; voluntary exercise; oxidative phosphorylation</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and, consequently, is involved in energy metabolism. Cardiolipin is released from necrotic cells following myocardial 
ischemia and reperfusion injury. Furthermore, increased levels of anxiety have been seen in individuals following myocardial infarction. Despite its various effects on liver, smooth and 
cardiac muscle, the impact of increased cardiolipin on skeletal muscle and anxiety-like behaviour remains unknown. PURPOSE. This two-part project investigated the effects of exogenous cardiolipin on voluntary exercise metrics, forced exercise training, functional aerobic capacity, anxiety-related behaviors, and mitochondrial respiration of skeletal muscle in a mouse 
model. METHODS. C57BL/6 mice were randomized to an experimental and a control group. The mice were injected 2x/week with 0.1ml of cardiolipin (0.25mg/ml or 0.5mg/ml) or placebo 
solution. In-cage running wheels measured voluntary running, while high-intensity interval training was used as a method of exercise training. Aerobic capacity was assessed by maximal 
endurance or maximal graded exercise tests. Open-field test and elevated plus maze served to measure anxiety-related behaviours. Lastly, mitochondrial respiratory capacity of the vastus 
lateralis muscle was measured by high-resolution respirometry. SIGNIFICANCE. Overall, this 
research has significant implications for advancing our understanding of cardiolipin biology, 
cardiovascular physiology, skeletal muscle function, and mental health, with potential 
implications for developing novel therapeutic interventions and improving patient outcomes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>“Just Because Children Are ‘Digital Natives’ Doesn’t Mean Parents Are Obsolete”: Exploring the Domestic Context of Youth Smartphone Mediation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lapointe, Camille</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Over the past year, issues surrounding “children and screens” have intensified both in Québec and internationally. While this topic is often addressed in the media and political discourse as a monolithic issue, this thesis focuses on a specific aspect: how francophone parents in Québec
regulate their children’s smartphone use within the household. The primary aim is to explore the strategies employed by parents to mediate smartphone usage, including the specific approaches they use and the goals behind these strategies. This research draws on interviews with parents of first-time smartphone users who have recently integrated smartphones into their households, as well as a Google search analysis of queries related to parental concerns about smartphone regulation. The findings reveal the multifaceted nature of parental mediation, highlighting the importance of digital media literacy in modern parenting. Gendered patterns also emerged, with mothers more likely to engage in online research, reflecting the emotional labor associated with parenting and concerns over children’s media consumption. Through this study, I contribute to a nuanced understanding of how parents navigate the complexities of digital regulation within the québécois family.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Considering its role in the development of Canada, its iconic landscapes and the extensive art production at the Banff Centre, Banff is a significant site of Canadian visual culture requiring further analysis. Technological innovations, grappled with by artists during the latter half of the twentieth century (Michael Century), featured in exhibitions, residencies and on-site DIY radio stations at the Banff Centre in the Eighties and Nineties, culminating in the exhibition, Radio Rethink (1992) at the Walter Phillips Gallery. This thesis challenges how art history incorporates, remembers and contends with ephemeral performance artworks involving live radio transmissions and public interventions. The analysis focuses on an interview between Daina Augaitis, the curator of Radio Rethink (1992), and participating artist, Colette Urban, as regards Urban’s multi-day, performance art walk, It’s on Your Head, It’s in Your Head (1992). Archives of Banff Centre exhibitions, such as, Between Views and Points of View (1991) and As Public As Race (1992), and performance artworks by Cheryl L’Hirondelle, Rebecca Belmore, Margo Kane, Camille Turner and Diana Burgoyne, contextualize Urban’s work within the milieu of art production at the Banff Centre and public performance art in Canada around the turn of the twentieth century. By attempting to intercept, collaborate and respond to the archival interview through site-writing (Jane Rendell) and an interdisciplinary methodology (Katherine McKittrick), this thesis enacts the archive to reconceptualize the way we write about ephemeral works in Canada, and the parameters of artistic and spatial agency in commercially constructed and federally implicated public spaces.</etd_ms:description>

Composites for Green Alternative Replacement in 
Alpine Sports: Scaling up between Laboratory and 
Field Testing</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>For ecological considerations, the International Ski Federation (FIS) has imposed a 
prohibition on the use of fluorinated waxes in ski and snowboard race preparation. Current
substitutes exhibit inferior friction-reducing properties. This assessment aims to corroborate
frictional performance in both laboratory-based evaluations and field trials. The evaluation 
employs a categorical approach, introducing incremental considerations for cost, lead time, and 
representativeness of actual competition conditions.
Traditional base material in snowboards, Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene 
(UHMWPE), serves as the baseline. Insights from aerospace investigations indicate that polymer 
composite structures with fibers aligned in the normal direction (NOFRC) exhibit performance in 
environments involving ice adhesion suggesting potential suitability for the cold and wet 
conditions characteristic of ski and snowboard competitions. Laboratory examinations include
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), tribometer 
tests utilizing a ball-on-disk linear tribometer (Anton-Paar TRB3 tribometer), contact angles, and 
time trials on High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) synthetic ice. 
Field testing incorporates the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) alongside 50-meter 
time trials conducted by athletes. Comparative analysis is conducted utilizing metrics such as 
surface energy, material composition, surface roughness values, coefficients of friction, and trial 
time. The findings reveal that, under conditions of dry friction and elevated temperatures, NOFRC 
demonstrates favorable tribological effects. However, UHMWPE emerges as the superior�performing material across all low temperatures and moisture instances. The consistency of 
categorical evaluations throughout the testing environments provides a valuable framework for 
appraising potential material alternatives for snowboard bases.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>research-creation, Indigenous educational sovereignty, Indigenous knowledge systems, Amazigh education, learning space, liminality, Amazigh weaving, decoloniality, virtual space</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This research-creation thesis examines the concept of learning space as a means of addressing liminality in both “learning" and "spatiality,” contrasting with the idea of a systematic, static, built enclosure. Recent research on educational spaces primarily reflects Western academic discourse, overlooking the fact that modern schooling models and their spatial concepts represent, for Indigenous peoples and other communities, a continuation of colonial legacies. By examining Indigenous (Amazigh) perspectives on space and learning, and using weaving as a pedagogical tool, the creative component accompanying the thesis provides an experimental foundation for a decolonial and dematerialized pedagogical space. It investigates the Amazigh concept of Asegmi (Indigenous education) and the transmission of Amazigh knowledge through weaving across homes and virtual spaces as a symbol of Indigenous educational sovereignty and resistance. It also presents Amazigh weaving as a spatial element that proposes an unstable logic that portrays the ambiguous relation between an individual's identity/knowledge and domestic/educational spaces in their solid form. This thesis unfolds as a series of theoretical explorations and experimentations which emphasize Indigenous ways of learning, non-architectural perspectives on learning spaces, and the introduction of a subverted virtual space that fosters the reimagining of Indigenous knowledge systems and practices.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis assesses the process and personal experience of volunteer guide training at Montreal’s McCord Stewart Museum.  The McCord’s mandate has changed from honouring David Ross McCord’s objective of establishing “an Indian museum” to endeavoring to be “an agent of change for a more just society.” This is indicative of an activist trend among social history museums which are moving towards a more social-justice oriented approach, decolonising, empowering people, and supporting participatory democracy. In this context, the role of museum guides is changing from a monologic, lecture-based one to a dialogic approach in which guides are expected to interact with visitors who often come with their own perceptions. My study documents how the McCord's changes have resulted in substantial revisions to its volunteer guide training program.  This has evolved from script-based teaching emphasizing a museum's collection to the methodologies of 'new museology' that promote skills in participation, learning, and tolerance. My preliminary data reflects the changing expectations of guides in social history museums more generally, with a particular focus on how guides can create emotional engagement for museum visitors.   My discussion draws on my field notes as I trained to be a volunteer guide and interviews with individuals involved with the McCord’s guide training program.  While most volunteer guides resigned when the McCord closed during the Covid pandemic, which began in March 2020, my interviews indicate that several factors led to their leaving, including changes in the McCord's approach to training while recasting itself as an 'activist museum'.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study examines the lived experiences and adaptation processes of refugee women in Quebec, Canada with their young children. The research focuses on understanding the complex challenges women encounter, including language barriers, employment difficulties, housing instability, and the absence of robust social support networks. Employing a phenomenological approach, the study captures the ways in which women navigate their new environment, emphasizing the role of resilience, community support, and individual coping strategies. The findings indicate that while refugee women express gratitude for the safety and opportunities provided in Canada, they face considerable obstacles in their daily lives, such as balancing child-rearing responsibilities with the need to acquire language proficiency and secure gainful employment. The study underscores the importance of targeted support systems to address the specific needs of refugee mothers, particularly in areas such as language acquisition, employment assistance, and access to flexible childcare. The insights gained from this research contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the refugee experience in Canada and highlight the necessity for policies that support the successful integration of refugee families.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Real-Time Neural Cloth Deformation using a Compact Latent Space and a Latent Vector Predictor</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lee, Chanhaeng</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>We propose a method for real-time cloth deformation using neural networks, especially for draping a garment on a human body. The computational overhead of most of the existing learning methods for cloth deformation often limits their use in interactive applications. Employing a two-stage training process, our method predicts garment deformations in real-time. 
In the first stage, a graph neural network extracts cloth vertex features which are compressed into a latent vector with a mesh convolution network. We then decode the latent vector to blend shape weights, which are fed to a trainable blend shape module. In the second stage, we freeze the latent extraction and train a latent predictor network. The predictor uses a subset of the inputs from the first stage, ensuring that inputs are restricted to those which are readily available in a typical game engine. Then, during inference, the latent predictor predicts the compacted latent which is processed by the decoder and blend shape networks from the first stage.
Our experiments demonstrate that our method effectively balances computational efficiency and realistic cloth deformation, making it suitable for real-time use in applications such as games.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>photovoice, environment, photography, visual literacy</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines how photovoice as a methodology can be used in a digital era to connect rural youth with their environment. To give agency to rural youth and empower the participants in our environmental crisis, I developed a photovoice workshop to foster a caring relationship with nature by anchoring my approach in environment pedagogy, place-based learning and Paulo Freire's theory of critical-action, critical-consciousness, and active learning. Using an adaptation of Caroline Wang and Mary Ann Burris' photovoice methodology, I adopted Aboulkacem et al.'s (2021) photovoice 2.0 method to address digital photography and the necessity for visual literacy. I facilitated a photovoice workshop for Grades 5 to 8 at a small community two hours north-west of Montreal, Quebec. The workshop was a 6-week extra-curricular activity held in the school library twice a week during the participant's 55-minute lunch break. The workshop's theme was the environment as we explored the forest behind the participant's school to engage in an eco-responsible relationship through photography and group discussions. The outcome was a group exhibit installed in the participant's school, where they invited the local and school community to attend their vernissage.

        <etd_ms:title>Home range size of freshwater fishes: a meta-analysis through a new lens</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lemay, Johnathan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Measuring the home range size of freshwater fishes provides crucial information on community structure, population dynamics, and conservation management. Earlier studies have shown that home range size increases with fish size, water body size, and trophic level, and that lake fishes have larger home ranges than stream fishes. However, in previous studies, there were sometimes conflicting findings, a lack of a standardized methodological approach, and some key variables that may influence home range were not considered. Using a systematic quantitative review of 272 studies, we revisited previous meta-analyses and evaluated the home range estimates in both lentic and lotic environments to verify whether home range: 1) increases with fish length, water body size, latitude, and study duration; 2) is influenced by trophic guild and data collection method; 3) decreases with the presence of dams; and 4) varies across fish family. Our results indicated that home range size was 4 times larger in lake than stream fishes and increased with fish length. However, home range size of lake fishes was mainly influenced by lake surface area and latitudinal gradient, not fish length. In streams, fish length, stream width, data collection method, and study duration all significantly influenced home range size. We also found significant fish family variation across lakes and streams when using the most robust available data from three families. These results demonstrate that the home range size of freshwater fishes was explained by different predictors in both lentic and lotic environments.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Indoor Depth Map Completion via Mesh-based Discrete Geometric Processing</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Liang, Zhenshan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Depth measurement serves as a pivotal technology with widespread applications, but limitations of commodity depth sensors often result in noisy and incomplete depth maps for indoor scenes. In response, this study introduces a discrete geometric processing-based method aimed at enhancing the completeness of indoor depth maps, particularly in intricate and challenging scenes. The proposed approach involves transforming raw depth maps into a quadrilateral mesh surface and addressing missing depth information through a mesh deformation framework. The mesh deformation framework employs iterations to update constraints on quadrilateral facets until convergence, tackling normal constraints, position constraints, and perspective projection constraints. This optimization problem is resolved using a combination of local shaping and global fusing strategies. In the local step, each quadrilateral facet is projected from the physical imaging plane into camera coordinate system based on perspective projection, preserving only orientation information. The global step then propagates location information through vertices shared by connected facets. Uncertainties in input normal and observed depth information are addressed through updating strategies. Experimental results on 30 selected examples from ScanNet dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over two existing techniques quantitatively and qualitatively. Specifically, the method excels in addressing depth discontinuity around object boundaries, producing clear disconnections, while competing methods exhibit errors and stretched distortions. Validating normal and depth updating strategies, the paper confirms the effectiveness of processing depth discontinuity in reducing completion errors. The robustness of the method is further affirmed by energy reductions in both normal and position aspects across iterations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Parametric Hydrogen Tank Sizing Model for Aircraft Conceptual Design</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Licheva, Gala</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Hydrogen-based propulsion is a promising research area for reducing aviation’s CO2 emissions. However, hydrogen’s low volumetric efficiency makes this alternative fuel challenging in terms of storage and integration into the aircraft. Developing parametric models becomes essential to allow sizing and exploration of possible hydrogen storage tank configurations and layouts within the aircraft. This thesis introduces a model and illustrates analysis capabilities, such as the effect of the variation in geometry on the overall tank volume and mass, which are key aspects to consider in conceptual design. The work presented here combines various methods from the literature into a new parametric approach considering filling and venting pressures, tank geometrical constraints, material properties, and thermal conditions. It supports the analysis of various tank configurations and layouts and allows trade-off studies on gravimetric and volumetric efficiencies to be conducted at the aircraft level. Validation was performed with industry storage tank data and showed an acceptable error range. Case studies illustrate the model capabilities for future hydrogen-powered aircraft configurations. These include tank geometry, thermal insulation, and tank layout-focused studies, allowing the exploration of various aspects of the hydrogen storage system design. Overall, the proposed tank sizing model supports the definition of a feasible design space for future, more environmentally friendly aircraft designs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis aims to redesign the nostalgic, early 2000’s dress-up game from a Cree perspective. Video games and digital media often reflect negative stereotypes of Indigenous peoples if they are included at all. The ability of Indigenous creators to use these tools to tell their own stories allows Indigenous peoples to take back and rewrite the narratives so often forced upon them. Examining projects and literature from Indigenous scholars provides context and guidance as to how others incorporate Indigenous values into their works. Other examples of independent dress-up games are examined to provide additional context as to how other creators subvert the genre with unique game design. Limitations of this research include the possible use of archival documents containing clothing designs belonging to other peoples and Nations, as well as considerations for Indigenous knowledges and values being incorporated respectfully. These issues highlight the importance of examining other works and guides by Indigenous creatives, as well as being grounded in Indigenous values like miyo-pimâtisiwin ¬-in order to conduct this work respectfully and in conversation with others to hold the researcher accountable to community. Wawêsîwin, the videogame produced through this research, is grounded in miyo-pimâtisiwin and is meant to be a joyful and nostalgic experience for Indigenous players, where they can see themselves in both the aesthetics and the design of the game itself.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Natural Disasters, Political Connections, Chinese Stock Market, Event Study, Abnormal Returns, Cross-Sectional Analysis</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper examines the impact of natural disasters on corporate stock price performance in China, with a particular focus on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned enterprises (POEs). Utilizing an event study methodology, we analyze the stock price reactions of Chinese companies to large-scale tropical cyclones from 2000 to 2022. Our findings indicate that these natural disasters have a significant negative impact on stock prices, particularly during the immediate impact period. SOEs, however, demonstrate greater resilience compared to POEs during the post-disaster recovery period, suggesting that political connections and government support provide advantages in mitigating market volatility. Cross-sectional regression analyses reveal that firms with high leverage, low profitability, smaller size, and low market valuation experience higher abnormal returns in the recovery phase, indicating a faster recovery rate. An industry-specific analysis further shows that the financial services sector performs better following natural disasters, potentially due to increased demand for financial products, access to government aid, and favorable investor sentiment.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>folk culture; tourism; visual spectacle</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This study examines the practices of constructing and disseminating tourism landscapes by the Chinese government, official media, and social media, using the Chagan Lake Winter Fishing and related tourism festivals as a case study. It reveals how the Chinese government leverages local ethnic cultures, guided by modernization ideology, to develop tourism festivals aiming at integrating ethnic minorities and rural populations into the modernization process. This study also examines the issues of rural tourism becoming ideologically charged and the marginalization of local communities in the modernization of China. Additionally, the study investigates the idealized and simplified representations of winter fishing in different media. CCTV's portrayal aligns with the central government's poverty alleviation through tourism policies and ecological civilization initiatives, while Xiaohongshu caters to users' demands for visibility and interaction. Since the ice and snow economy developed in 2015, winter fishing has become a replicable landscape promoted in northern regions, regardless of its alignment with local culture and fishing practices. The replicable landscape visually reinforces the perceived distance between ethnic minorities, rural populations, and modern society, emphasizing traditional and ethnic cultures as fundamentally distinct from modernization rather than genuinely integrating them into the development process. This study is significant as it highlights the conflict in the Chinese government's efforts to include rural populations and ethnic groups in modernization through tourism development, which paradoxically further marginalizes them and reinvents their cultures to fit the modernization agenda.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Can silk inform us of the past, the present and a reimagined future? This thesis mends together familial histories, intercultural learning, and community-based art education through research-creation. The research addresses silk’s history, production as a collaborative and cultural material in two components, a body of work exhibited at the Centre Culturel Georges-Vainer in Montréal, and a community workshop. The exhibition examines my first research question, above, and the silk moth through weaving, embroidery, and paper works alongside the forgotten experiences of my great-grandmother and family in diaspora. The art-making workshop, guided by the same research question, brought together communities in Montréal through needlework, conversations on materials considerations, and a collective art piece displayed in the exhibition. The research uses the theoretical lens of intercultural arts education to investigate my second research question: how can silk threads, storytelling, and community projects like my workshop connect cultures together, specifically in a diverse and multicultural city like Montréal? By examining the stories woven into silk, I address my third research question, how can projects such as Silk Cocoon contribute to inclusive intercultural art education in community settings? I offer a glimpse into a reimagined future where the threads of the past and present converge, guided by a deeper understanding of our relationship with materials, community, heritage, and the self.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the putative correlations between the modes of criminality and its correlations of historically depicting autism on screen in a negative light. By analysing selected pro eugenic propaganda films, the essay argues there has been a consistent pathology which has over time developed into a caricature common described as the “creep”. The Thesis demonstrates how this unique trope continues to negatively influence the way we see autism in films and media by exploring different film representations which involve autistic coded characters.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>A multilevel analysis conducted with a cross-sectional sample of 324 pre -adolescents (N= 324) in grades five and six (Mage = 11.5) of girls (N= 170) and boys from three mixed-gender primary school schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and two mixed-gender schools in Barranquilla, Colombia (N= 174) was used to examine the effect of group norms on peer perceived gender typicality. Group level variables including descriptive same-gender and other-gender group norms for each of the social behaviors.  SES, culture, and gender were examined as moderators of the association between four forms of gendered social behaviors, specifically care, justice, physical aggression, and relational aggression, and children’s perceptions of their peers as being typical members of their cis gender group categories.  Multilevel modeling indicated distinct patterns of effects for the level 2 group variables on the intercept and slope for each of the four social behaviors.  For the intercept, same-gender and other-gender group means were positively associated with gender typicality for three (care, justice and relational aggression) of the four behaviors. For the slope – gender typicality was high when other-gender group means for physical aggression, relational aggression and care were low.  Only relational aggression was found to be a significant predictor at level 1.  SES and place effects also found. The findings show that perceptions of gender typicality are contextually determined.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In North American cityscapes commuters must perform a specific set of gestures in order to efficiently move through and around public architectural spaces. The mass adoption of these gestures represents a form of extra-institutional learning facilitated by the choreographic characteristics of everyday architectural spaces. The urbanite’s quotidian movement through the built environment may then inform their understanding of what normative movement looks and feels like. The purpose of this research-creation thesis is to investigate how adult human cognition and epistemic formation is affected by bodily movement through contemporary urban architectural spaces. Locally there are few spaces where the procedural nature of city architecture is felt more than when using the underground public transportation network. For this reason, the Société de Transport de Montréal’s (STM’s) subterranean metro stations are the focal site of this inquiry. Using ethnographic (experimental field recordings and naturalistic observation) and arts-based methods (inconspicuous public performance and long-exposure film photography) this performance ethnography identified and analyzed recurrent patterns and rhythmic structures of Montreal’s underground architectures which cause these spaces to be propulsive for some and disabling for others. The findings of this qualitative study emphasized the hypervisibility of those whose bodies are dissociated from the rhythms of “normative” movement in these spaces. Though further studies are needed to draw a causal relationship between human cognition and the public spaces they inhabit, this thesis demonstrates the potential of arts-based research to create an output which mediates metric measurement and one’s embodied experiences of space for the purposes of research and critical reflection.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>MacLean, Alison</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis consists of ethnomusicological study of the life and legacy of Déise traditional sean-nós singer Nioclás Tóibín (1928-1994). Born in the Gaeltacht community of Na Déise, in Co. Waterford, Ireland, Tóibín was raised in the traditional Irish-language song culture of his community. He grew up in the first decade of Irish independence during a time of nation building. The new national identity, born from the cultural revivalism of the late 19th century, placed great symbolic importance on the promotion of the Irish-language and Gaelic culture, including music. During this time, there were also new technologies being introduced in Irish society, such as recording and broadcasting technology. Because of these factors, Tóibín’s musical career broke new ground for traditional singers from Gaeltacht na nDéise. Through interactions with revivalist institutions, such as Oireachtas na Gaeilge, and the promotion of Irish language music through recording labels like Gael-Linn and radio broadcast stations like Raidió na Gaeltachta, his voice became synonymous with the singing tradition of his community.

Using ethnographic interviews, this text is informed by the voices of sean-nós singers from Gaeltacht na nDéise who knew Tóibín, were influenced by him, and have experienced the unfolding of his legacy within their community since his death. This text considers the meaning of his memory, as well as how the success brought to Tóibín’s musical career through the interaction with recording and broadcasting technology has affected the sean-nós singing of Gaeltacht na nDéise.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Mutable “Type:” August Sander and the Politics of the Peasant Portrait in Antlitz der Zeit (Face of Our Time) (1929)</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mackay, Emmett</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Published in 1929, August Sander’s photobook Face of Our Time is one of the most celebrated photographic documents of the ill-fated Weimar Republic. Although Sander’s photobook included a broad typological spectrum of Weimar society and was eventually censured under National Socialism in 1936, scholars such as Leesa Rittelmann and George Baker have argued that Sander’s decision to foreground six portraits of peasant farmers at the outset of Face of Our Time can be understood as comparable to the romanticization of rural Aryan “types'' found in slightly later right-wing publications such as Erna Lendvai-Dircksen’s Face of the German Race of 1932. In response to this claim, I contend that this is a misinterpretation of Sander’s use of the peasant “type” which has cast the photographer’s œuvre in an undeservedly reactionary light. By drawing attention to Sander’s inclusion of key images of social change within the typological category of the peasant, I argue that Sander’s foregrounding of the peasant “type” is, in fact, a progressive acknowledgment of modernization rather than a reactionary statement on the disappearance of traditional, rural ways of life. In support of my argument, I carry out close readings of the six photographs in question while also attending to the ways in which these images form a narrative that asserts social change over fixed typological continuity. In doing so, my research sheds light on the ambiguous politics at the heart of Sander’s body of work and the ideological mutability of the peasant “motif” within twentieth-century German visual culture.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In the field of aerospace engineering, the enhancement of engine performance and reliability under extreme conditions is paramount. This study is dedicated to the development of polymeric abradable coatings for fan core and Low-Pressure Compressor stage. These coatings are specifically engineered to wear away in a controlled manner, thus reducing friction and improving the sealing capabilities of engines, a critical factor for optimizing efficiency.
The research evaluates two primary material types: thermosets and thermoplastics, comparing them against two commercially available materials which are epoxy based and named as ref1 and ref2. The assessment involves a series of tests, including erosion resistance, tribology pin-on-flat testing, and rub rig testing, to gauge the performance of these materials under operational stress.
Furthermore, the study explores the incorporation of various fillers—Graphite, Silicone Powder, PTFE, Carbon Nanotubes, Milled Carbon Fiber, Aramid Fiber, and Hollow Glass Microspheres—into selected thermoset. These fillers are evaluated at two distinct concentrations to ascertain their influence on erosion resistance.
Through this research, effective filler concentrations were identified, optimizing the balance between wear resistance and erosion resistance. Notably, a formulation comprising Epoxy with 10% PTFE, and 0.1% Carbon Nanotubes introduced as a potential abradable coating, exceeding the commercial benchmarks in terms of both erosion resistance and friction reduction.
This investigation underscores the critical role of precise material selection in the development of advanced abradable coatings that enhance the efficiency and longevity of aircraft turbine components, offering implications for future aerospace applications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis looks at the motives that affect the careers of business owner-managers. Using McClelland's Need Theory and Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, this research examines how achievement, power, and affiliation shift over time and affect decisions about whether to continue working or retire.
The study used a qualitative approach, conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with twelve business owner-managers over fifty years old. These interviews provided valuable insights into how their motives have changed throughout their lives, the challenges they face regarding retirement, and the effects of their decisions on themselves and their businesses. The analysis explored six themes: Achievement, Power, Affiliation, Emotional Fulfillment, Perceived Change, and Retirement Plans. These themes help explain why business owner-managers stay involved in their work even past the traditional retirement age.
The findings show that early in their careers, many business owner-managers focus on financial success, innovation, and influence. As they age, their priorities shift toward sustaining their businesses, creating a legacy, and building relationships. By exploring these changes, this thesis helps deepen our understanding of how aging business owner-managers manage their careers and what keeps them engaged. These insights are essential for the business community as it considers the significant impact of aging business owner-managers on sustainability and the economy.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring my Musicality as a New Music Therapist: A Heuristic Self-Inquiry</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Magidson, Benjamin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>It is important for music therapists to have musical self-awareness as it helps to ensure that they are not inadvertently imposing their pre-conceived personal and cultural notions of music aesthetics and musicality onto their clients. This research provided me with an opportunity to explore my current beliefs and assumptions about musicality and reflect upon how these might impact my work as a newly certified music therapist. Therefore, purpose of this heuristic self-inquiry was to reveal and examine assumptions that I hold about the concept of musicality and explore how these assumptions may inform my music therapy practice moving forward. As my family members’ musicianship has influenced my understanding of my own musicality and what it means to be musical at large, I engaged in an experiential self-inquiry process wherein I used  free improvisations and reflexive journaling to explore how I have reacted and responded to three family members within the context of our musical relationships and past musical interactions that we shared. This resulted in four narrative summaries along with a cross case analysis that revealed three overarching themes: musician self-concept, musical traumas, and newly revealed assumptions and biases on musicality. A creative synthesis in the form of a sound collage served as a representation of the personal and tacit dimensions of this research process. Limitations of the study along with potential implications for others’ clinical practice and future research are also presented.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Playing ‘Polly’: The Aesthetic Influence of Eighteenth-Century Actress Lavinia Fenton</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>Lavinia Fenton, Duchess of Bolton, Polly Peachum, The Beggar's Opera, John Gay, camp, eighteenth-century theatre, 18th century, feminism, sexuality</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>For centuries, critics have viewed Polly Peachum as the moral centre of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (1728). Actress Lavinia Fenton’s (1708-1760) influence on interpretations of Polly’s character may be tracked in eighteenth-century sources and continues to be discussed in contemporary criticism. Common across these discussions is the suggestion that Fenton’s performance embodied an innocent Polly possessed with moral virtue. This thesis argues that the misreading of Polly is largely owing to critics’ projection of aspects of Lavinia Fenton’s offstage experience onto Polly, and that this interweaving has had the effect of limiting our view of the actress, the character she made famous, and the creative agency it took to create the relationship between them. Rather than accepting and reiterating this outdated contextual frame, this thesis rereads several of Polly’s airs in The Beggar’s Opera as well as eighteenth-century accounts of Lavinia Fenton’s stage presence as preserved in reviews, ‘Polly’ fanfictions, and ‘Polly’s’ costume, to argue that it is more critically interesting, and more accurate, to focus on the pragmatic duplicity of these figures. Doing so sheds light on Fenton's significant literary and cultural contributions to The Beggar's Opera by establishing her investments in a campy performance style. This thesis also models a strategy for performance history that entails reading between the lines of historical sources in order to recreate the actions and motives they describe without the bias of sexism.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Therapeutic Songwriting with Bereaved Mothers Following Pregnancy Loss: A Philosophical Inquiry</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Maillard, Nathalie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>pregnancy loss, therapeutic songwriting, perinatal grief, perinatal bereavement</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Pregnancy loss is an under-researched and underacknowledged issue that affects many women. Furthermore, there is a lack of specialized support services. Given the unique needs of bereaved mothers and noted relevant benefits of therapeutic songwriting, the purpose of this philosophical inquiry was to organize and synthesize current knowledge and build a case as to why therapeutic songwriting within an individual music therapy context holds strong potential as a mode of support for these women. A first-person arts-informed research component was also employed, wherein relevant audio and lyrical excerpts from songs previously composed by the researcher about her own pregnancy losses were used to support and further elucidate knowledge that emerged from the literature. Connections were made between key components of an experience-oriented songwriting approach and the identified needs of bereaved mothers. Flexible guidelines for applying this approach were subsequently created and these may serve as a helpful starting point for music therapists wanting to offer services to this population. Limitations of the study as well as further implications for practice and research are presented.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Understanding the Lifecycle of Flaky Tests and Identifying
Flaky Failures</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Malmir, Samaneh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Software testing is a critical aspect of ensuring the quality of software. Ideally, tests should
produce consistent results when being executed repeatedly on the same version of the software.
However, certain tests may exhibit non-deterministic behavior, commonly known as ªflaky testsº.
These tests can provide ambiguous signals to developers and make the test results unreliable.
Despite being a recognized phenomenon for decades, academic attention towards test flakiness
has only recently increased. The current dissertation aims to contribute to the advancement of
research in two directions. First, we focus on predicting the lifetime of a flaky test, an issue that
has been left unaddressed in the flaky tests research area. Secondly, we question the efficiency of
previous studies in discerning flaky failures from legitimate failures, focusing on the Chromium
build result as our dataset.
In our investigation of the historical patterns of flaky tests in Chrome, we identified that 40% of
flaky tests remain unresolved, while 38% are typically addressed within the initial 15 days of introduction.
Subsequently, we developed a predictive model focused on identifying tests with quicker
resolutions. Our model demonstrated a precision of 73% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient
(MCC) approaching 0.39 in forecasting the lifespan class of flaky tests.
Furthermore, we discovered that current vocabulary-based flaky test detection approaches misclassify
78% of legitimate failures as flaky failures when applied to the Chromium dataset. The
results also revealed that the source code of tests is not enough indicator for predicting flaky failures,
and other execution-related features must be contributed for better performance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>WARNE: A Stalkerware Evidence Collection Tool</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mangeard, Philippe</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a form of abuse in romantic relationships, more frequently, against the female partner. IPV can vary in severity and frequency, ranging from emotional abuse or stalking to recurring and severe violent episodes over a long period. 
Easy access to Stalkerware apps helps foster such behaviors by allowing non-tech-savvy individuals to spy on their victims. 
These apps offer features for discreetly monitoring and remotely controlling compromised mobile devices, thereby infringing the victim's privacy and the security of their data.
In this work, we investigate methods for gathering evidence about an abuser and the Stalkerware they employ on a victim's device. We develop a semi-automated tool intended for use by investigators, helping them to analyze Android phones for potential threats in cases of IPV Stalkerware. As a first step towards this goal, we perform an experimental privacy and security study to investigate currently available Stalkerware apps. 
We specifically study the vectors through which vulnerabilities found in Stalkerware apps could be exploited by investigators.
We then design and implement a tool called WARNE, leveraging the identified flaws to facilitate the information and evidence collection process. Our tool generates reports containing all available information about potential Stalkerware present on a victim's device.
To ensure a better usability of WARNE, we also come up with report parsing mechanisms involving generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs). This genre of Natural Language Processing models is suited for large text analysis and information extraction.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Eye, the Heart, and the Network: the Humanistic Blogging of Tumblr’s Webweaving Community</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Margaron, Amelle</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Webweaving is a networked, creative archival practice hosted on the social blogging platform Tumblr. Weavers combine text, images, and other media elements and compile them into posts reflecting personal or intimate themes which fellow users can then share and recreate. The creative process of weaving reflects the values and ethics of Web 1.0 (connectivity, expression, dehiearchized content) and as such does not follow conventional trajectories of platform presence and art consumption of the contemporary digital landscape. Employing network ethnography and research-creation, this thesis answers three major questions. First: what is webweaving? Second: what does webweaving reveal about cultural production and digital life on Tumblr? Third: how do Tumblr users use webweaving to create humanistic meaning and connection online in an increasingly corporate platform landscape?  
'
Operating at the intersection of platform studies and digital art history, this thesis documents an understudied and uniquely ‘born digital’ creative phenomenon. Drawing from theoretical frameworks like Jennifer Pybus’ work on platforms as archives of feelings, we build on existing platform theory to study the symbiotic relationship between art and community. Finally, we fill a research gap in the paradoxical nature of the Tumblr user experience in 2024, as weavers participate in thriving and irreplicable digital life on a platform that is considered long past its prime.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Marion-Reyes, Marguerite Isabelle</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Experimental Video; Weird; Climate Change; Grief; Place.</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis is an account of my experience of living-with a place through Research-Creation and Heuristics. During the summer of 2023 I walked and recorded the city of Montreal, exploring what experimental video could teach me about being in a place and what it might inform my pedagogical thinking and future practice. While recording every day and returning to the archives, I created four experimental videos, six post-edition images from the stills included as In-between sections connecting chapters along the text, and an art website. All these Research-Creation results relate to the experience of feeling a place and climate change. Noticing those sometimes small or big, yet always heavy differences from day to day, mingled with what is expected of a season, concepts of grief of landscape, weirdness and living-with are strongly connected to the findings. This thesis concludes with the conception of a teaching philosophy that reflects on how this research has influenced my art and educational thinking of living in the era of the Pyrocene.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Influence of Interior Design on High School Students' Well-being and Stress Perceptions: A Case Study of The Math Guru Tutoring Studio</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Marks, Sara</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This qualitative case study draws upon personal narratives and academic insights from education, psychology, and interior design, offering a comprehensive exploration of the lived experiences of three high school students at The Math Guru tutoring studio, with a focus on how students perceive the studio's distinct interior design in relation to their experiences of school-related stress and learning. Central to this inquiry is a thematic analysis that considers the founder of The Math Guru’s interior design intentions and how these design choices resonate with students’ perceptions of well-being. The study employs a triangulation approach, with in-depth, semi-structured interviews complemented by on-site photography and observations. The findings illustrate how The Math Guru’s interior design, characterized by its aesthetic appeal, comfortable furniture selection, and adaptable spatial dynamics, contributes to students feeling less stressed, more engaged, and generally happier than in their standard school settings. By offering a detailed description of the role of interior design in shaping students' perceptions and experiences of well-being and learning, this research presents The Math Guru’s homelike design strategy as an inspirational model for future learning environment design. This study aims to act as a catalyst, encouraging secondary education institutions, along with the educators, designers, and policymakers who shape them, to recognize interior design as a valuable approach to enhancing student well-being, particularly in the context of school-related stress.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Comparative Analysis of Game Asset Creation Using
Conventional and AI Methods</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Markutsa, Viktoriya</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) field is having a significant impact on many industries, as well as individuals. ChatGPT and image generating applications are undoubtedly among the most well-known and widely utilized AI tools. It is interesting to explore how these AI tools may be used in video games, specifically for asset creation, and how they compare to more traditional methods.

This thesis investigates the creation of video game assets using traditional techniques and AI tools such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. A group of 34 participants, each with varying levels of experience in different techniques and asset production, were given the task of creating basic game components using both traditional and AI tools. The goal was to rank both methods according to the overall rating, the satisfaction of the end result, and the ease of use to determine which one is preferred. The sample scene was a simple 2D platformer game, similar to Mario, with which most people are familiar and most likely played at some point. The participants were involved in both the creation process of game assets, as well as their evaluation, which brings a new perspective on the matter. It was discovered that, on average, AI tools are rated higher and are simpler to use than traditional approaches. Participants were highly satisfied with the results. However, the content created in such a way may not be as creative or as tailored for the specific needs as content made by people. Using these technologies makes it difficult to maintain a consistent style or create exactly what the person envisions, as compared to producing them manually, when the artist has complete control over every step and detail. Both methodologies have value, and depending on the project's goals and available resources, one may be preferred over the other. A hybrid method, which combines AI efficiency with artist creativity, may be the best option.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Molecular Dynamics-Based Study of the Effect of Hydrogen on the Mechanical Properties of Fe-C System</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Martinez, Carlos</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) significantly impacts high-strength steels by reducing ductility and promoting brittleness. Research has shifted towards multifaceted approaches, with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at the atomic scale being crucial. In this research, MD was employed using two interatomic potentials to investigate the role of hydrogen in Fe-C systems. The atomic models maintained a consistent carbon concentration while varying concentrations of hydrogen and progressed from single-crystalline through bicrystalline to polycrystalline models, increasing complexity and incorporating grain boundaries (GBs). Results showed a general decline in mechanical properties of the Fe-C system with increasing hydrogen content, with the failure outcome being influenced by simulation boundary conditions such as fully-periodic compared to shrink-wrapped in the pulling direction. The impact of hydrogen varied by crystal direction, highlighting anisotropy. Hydrogen significantly increased local vacancy and void formation, leading to earlier fracture initiation, and strongly suggesting the hydrogen-enhanced strain-induced vacancies (HESIV) mechanism among those commonly proposed for HE. Although evidence for the hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanism was limited, a potential synergistic effect with HESIV was suggested. The influence of hydrogen on dislocation density varied, and phase transformations (BCC to FCC/HCP) were frequent, driven by stress, crystal orientation, and potential type. Despite limitations, MD provides key insights into HE, underscoring the need to integrate simulation results with experimental data for a comprehensive understanding.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is one of additive manufacturing (AM) methods and owns notable advantages like enabling production of large-scale components. However, the current WAAM has inherent drawbacks, such as heat accumulation and near-net-shape production issues that can lead to defects like geometrical deviations, porosity inside the weld and/or surface irregularities. It is noted that various process parameters are directly related to the above-mentioned production issues. Therefore, it is crucial to set various process parameters (based on geometry, processing changes when depositing, etc.) appropriately for achieving a good quality of product
In this project, we aimed to investigate the influence of various process parameters on the product quality and to automate the WAAM process using a vision system. To realize the objectives, we have developed an adaptive correction strategy to control the robotic welding machine, i.e. a Nertamatic power source that centralize the welding cycle while considering various welding parameters such as the robot path, deposited layer height, surface contamination, etc. To minimize operator intervention, a Cognex 3D A5000 series camera was employed to scan/monitor the deposited object layer by layer. The camera’s ASCII output was used for mesh processing. An on-line control scheme has been developed to control the robot path according to the dimensions of previous layers and thus the robot’s height was adaptively adjusted. An algorithm was proposed to process the mesh data to detect and correct the inconsistencies by commanding the robot to stop in case of collisions or fill cavities in the case of insufficient height or underfills.
An experiment has been designed on a robotic WAAM machine where a TopTig gun was attached to the end effector of a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) ABB robot IRB4600, equipped with a 2-DOF IRBP_A500 table, to deposit material layer by layer. A nozzle is mounted with different diameter tungsten electrodes and fed with various wire materials. In this study, we tested a 3 mm diameter tungsten electrode and stainless-steel filler wire to assess the effects of overlap between the beads on the integrity of the deposited part. Simulations have been conducted in RobotStudio software to validate the recognizing deposited layer inconsistencies and the effectiveness of the path planning and welding machine settings, demonstrating the potential for deploying the adaptive correction strategy in the WAAM process.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the intricate dynamics between TikTok’s algorithm and content creators by examining the interaction between digital materials and human agency. TikTok, a social media giant, is known for its personalized and engaging content. The platform transforms how digital content is created and consumed through its advanced machine-learning algorithm, AI. The study is inspired by the theoretical perspectives of New Materialism, Networked Individualism, and the Virtual Self, which provide a deep understanding of the interplay between technology and human behavior. With three methodological approaches, including digital autoethnography, digital ethnography, and semi-structured interviews, this research explores how TikTok’s algorithm is influenced by content creators. While content creators try to manipulate the algorithm to boost their exposure and engagement, the algorithm, at the same time, changes their content and creative abilities. This suggests a complex mutual relationship. Moreover, this study adds to the wider discussion of algorithmic transparency, and the impact of AI on digital platforms. It highlights the need to further study the power structures embedded in digital technologies. Overall, we gain insights into digital interactions' evolving nature and algorithms' impact on cultural production and individual agency.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>An increase in youth sport specialization prevalence has been associated with an increase injury rate and a decrease in movement competence. However, movement competence has not been compared between the degrees of sport specialization in 8- to 12-year-old football players. The purpose of the study is to primarily observe the relationship between movement competence and the degree of youth sports specialization in 8- to 12-year-old football players using the Child Focused Injury Risk Screening Tool (ChildFIRST). Secondly, the study aims to observe the differences amongst positions and the association for injury prevalence. We hypothesize that youth football players with a higher youth sport specialization categorization will have a lower movement competency. We also hypothesize that there with be a difference in movement competency amongst football positions.
 
During practices in the 2023 football season, 8- to 12-year-old football players from the Montreal Regional Football League were asked to complete an injury and youth sport specialization questionnaire. Participants were then assessed using the ChildFIRST. There was no significant association between ChildFIRST composite score and youth sport specialization score. When looking at the differences amongst positions, linemen had a significantly lower ChildFIRST composite score mean than other positions. No association with injury and movement competence was observed. Future studies should continue observing the movement competency in 8- to 12-year-old football players differentiating by their playing position. Such findings could contribute towards the development of an evidence-based injury prevention program for youth football players.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Lipidomics is the study of lipids in biological matrices. Challenges in the field include the use of toxic solvents and data harmonization. Ionic liquids (ILs), organic salts that can extract organic compounds and biomolecules, offer potential solutions, has not been extensively studied for lipidomics. Two ILs, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate and trihexyltetradecylphosphonium hexafluorophosphate, were assessed for lipid extraction using IL dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction with methanol as a disperser. Both ILs showed selectivity towards lipids of intermediate polarity, with limited extraction efficiency towards more polar lipids. However, slight solubility of ILs in the aqueous layer led to significant ion suppression for lipids tested when analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Overall, the tested ILs were unsuitable for untargeted lipidomics of plasma. 
Internal standards are commonly used for semi-quantification in untargeted lipidomics. However, electrospray ionization (ESI) differences between internal standards and endogenous lipids can impact quantification accuracy. The adduct formation for phospholipids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, and sterol lipids was studied in human plasma, murine plasma, murine spinal cord, and murine liver tissue. Within-class adduct formation was consistent for most lipid classes, except for diglyceride and cholesteryl ester lipid subclasses, necessitating multiple internal standards. Mismatch between internal standard and endogenous lipid adduct formation was observed for phosphocholine, ceramide, triglyceride, diglycerol, and cholesteryl ester lipid subclasses in at least one of the four matrices. Inter-batch variability in sodium concentrations significantly influenced sodium adduct formation and could not be controlled with usage of ammonium volatile salts. Finally, monoglycerides and diglycerides were detected to form acetate adducts in ESI-.</etd_ms:description>

Through examining such a poetics, found across a selection of lesbian works of grief, I critique the modes by which the state coerces, co-opts, and mobilizes a certain crafting of the body and memory in efforts to amass and concentrate power, as well as how desire and grief are taken up both in service of, and counter to, such statecraft operations. I aim to both emphasize and take part in a lesbian poetics that destroys the very terms of empire–fleeing its own uptake and offering nothing to fill this gap; no balm for this uncertainty.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Long-Term Assessment of Cardiac and Behavioral Phenotypes in Mice with Chronic Heart Failure</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mc Manus, Megan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Introduction: Heart failure patients have a significant depression risk, with two-to-three-times higher possibility compared to the general population (Rustad et al., 2013). Diminished cerebral oxygen supply from reduced perfusion in heart failure may play a role in the development of mood disorders (Mueller et al., 2020). Suffering from both conditions increases hospitalization and mortality rates compared to patients without depression (Celano &amp; Huffman, 2018). New research is needed for better patient outcomes. Previous murine studies induce cardiac impairments acutely (Frey et al. 2014). However, progressively induced heart failure studies assessing behavior over time are lacking. 

Objectives: The aims of this study were: 1) to identify specific timepoints where cardiac phenotypes became more pronounced and, 2) to establish a clear link between the severity of cardiac impairments and the expression of depressive symptoms.

Methods: The plan was to gradually induce heart failure using viral vectors to modify the cardiomyocyte circadian clock through the removal of the clock gene brain and muscle ARNT-Like 1 (Bmal1) (Young et al. 2014). Cardiac and behavioral phenotypes were assessed using heart function and behavior tests.

Results: Immunoblotting analysis revealed no difference in BMAL1 protein levels in control and knockout animals. Consistent with the inability to cause heart failure, cardiac and behavioral phenotypes tested were not significantly different between control and experimental groups over time (p &gt; 0.05). 

Conclusion: The heart-brain relationship remains an important research topic. Future experiments should test viral vectors efficiency at larger concentrations and measure differences in BMAL1 protein expression in heart tissue.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>McCauley, Michael</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper offers a close reading of the transition into the “Self-Consciousness” chapter of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit. In this transition, Hegel articulates a concept of self-consciousness that is closely bound up with his concept of life. This paper’s central interpretive argument is that life plays an instructive role for self-consciousness, demonstrating to it that its most basic concept of selfhood is dependent upon the concrete, finite, embodied activity of organic nature. To this end, this paper asks what is required of Hegel’s concept of life such that it may play this role, explicating the concept of the living body presented at the beginning of the fourth chapter as a phenomenological object in which self-consciousness recognizes something of its own minimal conception of itself. In this moment of recognition, self-consciousness also grasps a constitutive difference that separates it from the living body, and this difference is a key condition of life serving its central instructive role. Contrasting this interpretation with recent scholarship on this passage, the paper argues that this concept of the living body and its instructive difference from self-consciousness suggest an approach to this chapter’s famous passages on recognition and the struggle of lord and bondsman that is grounded in self-consciousness’s recognition of life at the start of the chapter.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Foucault’s Late Theory: Politics and Thought</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>McKenna, Patrick</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Recent literature has claimed that Michel Foucault’s late work amounts to a rejection of politics and an embracing of a neoliberal logic and an individualizing ethics. This thesis is situated in a response to this recent literature which reads in Foucault’s late work several political commitments and avenues for investigation that remained unfinished. Specifically, this thesis examines two understandings of politics in the work of Foucault: politics as civil war and politics as singular thought. The introduction situates this thesis’s content in the context of the crisis of Marxism in the 1960s through to the 1980s, as Marxist conceptions and practices of politics began to meet their limits. The first chapter of this thesis traces the development of an initial concept of politics as civil war in Foucault’s work over the course of several years utilizing a method of reading from Étienne Balibar’s examination of the same concept in the work of Karl Marx. The second chapter of this thesis provides a comparative reading of the work of Sylvain Lazarus and the later work of Michel Foucault to illuminate their differing concepts of singularity and the irreducibility of politics. Reading Lazarus’s critique of Foucault’s conception of singularity presented in The Order of Things and an exchange between Foucault and a group known as the Cercle d’Épistémologie points the way to Foucault’s late work on spirituality and the transformable subject and a new theory of politics as singular thought founded on a political spirituality and a rupture of the everyday.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis addresses the critical challenge of achieving real-time and precise calibration for multi-camera systems, particularly crucial for applications demanding high precision. Departing from conventional methodologies characterized by limited adaptability and incapacity for on-the-fly recalibrations, this research introduces an innovative neural network-based approach designed to facilitate dynamic real-time calibration. This work incorporates the camera pose synthesis pipeline to simulate real-world camera parameters, introducing various levels of perturbation to the camera parameters to enhance model robustness. Also, a differentiable projection model is utilized to establish a direct correlation between 3D geometries and their 2D image projections, thereby facilitating concurrent optimization of intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. This solution entails a multi-headed deep neural network regression model and is tailored for multi-camera systems equipped with onboard processing capabilities, leveraging direct 2D projections of 3D fiducials. A comprehensive series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior efficacy of the proposed method over traditional calibration techniques. This research contributes significantly to the advancement of real-time multi-camera system calibration, offering promising implications for diverse domains reliant on precise temporal synchronization and spatial accuracy.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Sport specialization, Sport injury, sex, sport type, children, adolescent.</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Purpose: Sport specialization can cause physical injuries in athletes, but the impact of sport specialization in child and adolescent athletes aged 8 to 18 in Iran is unknown. This study aims to examine the presence of sport specialization and its associations with sex, sport type, and history of sport-related injuries.
Method: Participants completed two questionnaires. The first questionnaire consisted of the sports specialization level and participants’ demographic data, including age, sex, sport type, and physical activity participation (hours of sport participation, rest days). The second questionnaire focused on participants’ sport-related injury history. 
Result: The study confirmed the presence of youth sport specialization among athletes in this age group in Iran. No association was found between injury history and participants' sex, sport type, or sport specialization.
Conclusion: While we found the presence of sport specialization in Iran, there was no significant association between participants' sport specialization, sex, sport type, and history of sport-related injuries. However, athletes that trained more than 8 months annually in a primary sport had a positive association with prior injuries. There was a significant difference in training intensity, particularly when exceeding 8 months per year, between those with and without a history of injury. This difference underscores the impact of extended training on injury susceptibility.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Mensah, Lord</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This dissertation seeks to apply the framework of Kumar, Webber, and Perry (2012), who studied the interconnection between the inflation rate, real wages, and labor productivity in Australia to the Canadian context. To attain the primary objective of this research, the study utilized monthly data from January 2000 to 2023, sourced from CANSIM, Statistics Canada. The unit root test showed that all variables were stationary at the first level differential, paving the way for applying the Vector Error Correction Model and Granger causality, which estimate the long and short-run effects. The main finding shows that the inflation rate and real wages positively drive labor productivity; thus, a 1% surge in real wage propels labor productivity to increase by 0.406%, while a 1% rise in inflation rate increases labor productivity by 0.115% in the long run, holding all other factors constant. In the short run, my results indicate a two-way directional Granger causality between the inflation rate and real wage, suggesting that past values of inflation influence current real wages and, reciprocally, past values of real wages impact current inflation. Although this study partially agrees with Kumar et al.’s (2012) findings, the partial differences in both studies could be attributed to the heterogeneous nature of individual economies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This educational action research aimed to explore how applied theatre and visual
activities can be tailored to meet the needs of Welcome Class teachers' pedagogy and be easily
implemented. The collaborative research process involved introducing ten 'd’accueil' Montreal
public elementary school teachers to a wide selection of drama games and performative and
visual activities during two research workshop sessions in the spring of 2024. To improve
communication and understand the socioemotional and linguistic needs of their immigrant,
refugee, and asylum seeker students, the teachers applied new activities in their classrooms
between the first and second workshop sessions. They maintained an 'Activity Journal' to
document their personal process of facilitating, noting students' reactions and outcomes, and
reflecting by sharing with the researcher and their peers and offering modifications to the
activities. This collaborative method enabled and encouraged participants to share experiences,
support each other with resources, and enrich their curricula.
The research outcomes revealed constant struggles teachers encounter, such as a lack of
communication with families due to linguistic and cultural differences related behaviours, pre-
and post-migration traumatic outbursts, and a lack of personal support from their institutions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Social Class, Happiness, Materialism, Gratitude, Marketing, Well-being</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>In a world where consumption is becoming increasingly accessible with online retailers, where social media influencers equate material possessions to happiness, convenience, or success, and where shopping has been proven to boost our mood, it is no wonder that consumers are struggling to control their buying behaviour. This research examines the impact of social classes on materialism, focusing on the mediating role of happiness and the moderating role of gratitude. An experimental research design was implemented, and two online surveys were utilized to collect data. In study 1, an unexpected, though interesting, effect of perceived social class on materialism was found. It was also found, as predicted, an effect of perceived social class on happiness, which in turn, predicted materialistic values; however, the mediating effect of happiness was not found to be significant. In study 2, as predicted, an effect between perceived happiness and gratitude was found. Additionally, gratitude had an effect on materialism. However, the moderating effect of gratitude was not found to be significant. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into how different social classes impact happiness levels, how happiness plays a role in materialism, and how practicing gratitude can influence your materialism levels. This study also offers practical implications for marketers to effectively target and position marketing messages, and for consumers to make more thoughtful purchase decisions that may enhance their well-being, as well as society’s.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Mohammad Nia, Mahla</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The concept of the eco-tech pavilion aligns with urban design’s commitment to sustainability within the unique context of Nordicity, characterized by prolonged winters and a focus on environmental resilience. This research explores the potential of eco-tech pavilions as a solution to urban challenges in Nordic regions, particularly focusing on the winter climate. Using content analysis as a generative method, the central inquiry of this study revolves around how integrating elements of Nordicity into an eco-tech pavilion's design can enhance socio-environmental sustainability during the winter months. To address this question, a thorough literature review methodology is adopted, involving the collection of a comprehensive dataset from existing scholarly works, employing content analysis methods, and utilizing Leximancer software for deeper insights. The aim is to uncover design patterns and conceptual guidelines for eco-tech pavilions tailored to nordic requirements. Subsequently, a research-through-design (RtD) approach is initiated, utilizing 3D software (Rhino) and rendering techniques (Lumion) to propose a conceptual design. The study’s findings underscore the importance of an integrated approach to two pivotal criteria: designing for locality and climate resilience. For example, incorporating design elements such as spherical structures, active solar heating and natural light distribution can significantly boost the eco-tech pavilion’s energy efficiency. Furthermore, strategic design features such as expansive windows and biophilic interior designs can collectively contribute to enhancing well-being and fostering community engagement. By advocating for an integrated approach to the conceptual design of an eco-tech pavilion, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable urban development within nordic contexts, aiming to improve socio-environmental sustainability.

        <etd_ms:title>Evaluating System Robustness Against Single Effect Upsets with
Triple Modular Redundancy Integration</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mohammed, Aya</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Many-core Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) processors offer a promising solution
for meeting the performance and cost requirements of safety-critical avionics applications.
However, the increased transistor count in these processors makes them more prone to soft
errors, potentially leading to system failures. This raises challenges in integrating their use
in critical applications due to limited research on how to mitigate the radiation-induced
soft errors on open-source many-core processors. Various mitigation strategies have been
proposed, including hardware and software techniques. Despite these efforts, a significant
gap remains, largely due to the inefficient use of multi-core processor resources.
Our work addresses this gap by integrating Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) into
OpenPiton, an open-source many-core processor while maintaining minimal time and area
overhead. This integration enhances the system’s robustness against soft errors, leveraging
unused cores for redundant threads, thus improving overall reliability. Our methodology
includes detailed implementation strategies for multi-threaded TMR, addressing key issues
such as synchronization across cores and race conditions. This study contributes to the field
by introducing a novel TMR implementation for many-core processors and advancing the
integration of fault tolerance mechanisms in complex computing environments, offering a
robust solution for critical applications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Urbanization impacts wildlife survival by altering foraging decisions and introducing anthropogenic food sources, like waste. Foraging behaviours are critical to animal survival, and understanding these decisions provides insights into species adaptation and resilience, which can inform biodiversity conservation strategies. While the physical impacts of ingesting waste are well-documented, the nuanced behavioural aspects are often overlooked. This thesis explored foraging route choice among Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) through an experimental field study on wild urban squirrels, compared these data with Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), and investigated how anthropogenic food sources alter foraging strategies in urban vertebrates through a literature review. In Chapter 2, I used a 1mx2m multi-destination, Z-shaped foraging array to collect 62 foraging trials on squirrels at Mount Royal Park in Montreal. Comparing these data with macaque data from Joyce et al. (2021), I found that squirrels (1) foraged more slowly, (2) exhibited a higher rate of platform revisiting, and (3) chose routes consistent with heuristic use at a similar rate to macaques. Observations also indicated that garbage and human food waste were an important part of the squirrels’ diet, leading to Chapter 3's exploration of how urban trash affects wildlife behaviour. I found that urban species foraging on waste modify their behaviours in various ways, including adopting new behaviours, changes in foraging methods, timing, energy budgets and social behaviours. My research enhances our understanding of urban mammal foraging behaviour and my literature review highlights the specific behaviours urban species adopt to thrive in urbanized settings.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The Way to the Hills is a novella exploring themes of loss, and of being lost. It chronicles five months in the life of Laura, a middle-aged woman who grows obsessed with finding both a reason, and a solution, to her inability to orient herself in space after her mother’s death, and her divorce. As Laura’s physical and psychological disorientation increases, manifesting itself as aimless wandering, insomnia, guilt feelings, and a strong pull towards her youth, she becomes dangerously detached from her immediate surroundings. The novella, set in present-day Montreal with several flashbacks to Northern Italy in the Eighties, eventually answers Laura’s enigma about orientation, but ends opening up the possibility that, maybe, being lost is just part of life.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research focuses on shifting vital chemical production from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives, 
particularly through biomass-based pathways. Promising methods using agricultural waste show 
potential for sustainable production, contributing to a resilient, resource-conscious future for the 
chemical sector and supporting climate targets through innovative bio-based solutions. The current 
research focuses on utilizing bio-based production routes, particularly biochemical pathways 
originating from agricultural biomass to derive bio-polyethylene. Six production pathways are analyzed 
base on different pretreatment methods: dilute acid, hot water, ammonia fiber explosion, steam 
explosion, organic solvent and alkaline. The primary objective is to provide a decision support system 
among the available process options and identify promising integrated production routes based on costs, 
resources, and energy demands inherent in these processes. This evaluation is conducted using mixed�integer linear programming modeling techniques, which enables the selection of technologies from a 
broader range of production routes and optimizes their integration. The results from this modeling 
indicate that the dilute acid pretreatment production route proves to be the most cost-efficient, followed 
by steam explosion. The findings offer valuable insights into variations in primary resource usage and 
energy demands based on the pretreatment methods employed to yield the final product. Investment 
costs associated with each process unit facilitate a comparative economic analysis and highlight avenues 
for potential cost reduction. This approach aids in assessing the feasibility and advantages of various 
bio-based processes toward industrial production, to be complemented by thorough environmental 
assessment in future work.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Hydrogels are a class of material that have garnered a great deal of attention across the domain of tissue engineering as potential candidates for tissue mimicking materials. Their softness and customizability make them very versatile in their applications and allows their specific properties to be optimized based on the intended applications. This thesis explores the viability of hydrogels as tissue mimicking materials. First, a comprehensive literature review introduces the mechanical properties of the soft tissues around the knee, specifically skin, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. This chapter also outlines different strategies used to improve the performance of hydrogels in mimicking the soft tissues around the knee, which is the biggest joint in the human body. Next, the experimental section of the thesis outlines the development of a hydrogel using solvent exchange and annealing. This chapter discusses the improved compressive mechanical properties of the developed hydrogel, as well as the impacts of glycerol and thermal annealing on the hydrogel.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Monjazeb, Niki</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The process of data preparation is a time-consuming portion of data scientists' work. Being able to automate this work will improve the quality of the machine learning results and free data scientists to shift their focus to the machine learning task at hand. My research presents a system to automate this process by learning from the data preparation steps taken from others working on similar datasets. To automate data cleaning and transformation, datasets and their corresponding notebooks were extracted from Kaggle, their information was abstracted before being uploaded into a knowledge graph. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models were trained on those knowledge graphs, and the most commonly used cleaning and transformation operations for similar datasets were inferred. These operations are offered to the user as recommendations that they can apply to their dataset using the corresponding APIs. These recommendations have outperformed their state-of-the-arts counterparts in terms of time, memory consumption, and accuracy.  To detect similarity inclusion dependencies (sIND), knowledge graphs from datasets in the Prague Relational Learning Repository were created. From those knowledge graphs, the columns deemed to have an inclusion dependency were studied until features leading to this dependency were observed. These features were used to create a model that could predict the sIND between columns. The resulting model was able to correctly predict more sIND pairs, in a shorter timespan than its competitor. This holistic platform can easily be integrated into any Data Science Pipeline (DSP) and facilitate the data preparation process for data scientists.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Le Canada est un pays reconnu à l’international pour son ouverture et sa tolérance envers les personnes LGBTQ+ et en tant que pays d’immigration. La diversité multiculturelle du pays a bien été représentée dans les trois premières saisons de Canada’s Drag Race avec des participantes drag queens provenant notamment, des minorités culturelles, de l’immigration, des membres des peuples autochtones, des réfugiées et des francophones. Néanmoins, malgré cette diversité des participantes , l’émission n’a pas permis l’expression d’une vision contradictoire au nationalisme canadien et a encensé son multiculturalisme et son ouverture précisément aux réfugiés queers, avec peu de moments contraires à ce mythe de la tolérance et de l’ouverture. Ainsi l’émission a reproduit le discours du mythe de la tolérance et de l’ouverture multiculturelle du Canada en décrivant à plusieurs reprises, les pays « étrangers » comme homophobes, et en appliquant un discours normatif sur les personnes de l’immigration comme son système d’immigration. En créant un triptyque mère-drag-patrie-commissaire, l’émission reproduit la logique nationaliste du Canada sans les altérer et renforce le discours du Canada comme terre d’accueil pour les personnes queers.

Abstract
Canada is recognized around the world for is openness and tolerance toward LGBTQ+ people and as a country open to immigration. Having drag queens from immigrant, refugee, indigenous and French-Canadian background, the first three seasons of Canada’s Drag Race reflected the multicultural diversity of the country. Nonetheless, even with this diversity of drag queens in the race, the program didn’t allow the participants to express a more contentious vision of Canada’s nationalism and praised the multiculturalism of the nation and his acceptance precisely toward queer refugees without contradicting its openness and tolerance myth. Canada’s Drag Race reproduced the openness and tolerance myth of Canada emphasizing the homophobia of foreign countries, strengthening the perception of Canada as a safe haven for queer people and assigning a normative discourse regarding immigrant people like in its immigration apparatus. By creating a triptych drag-mother-land-IRB members, the TV series reproduced the Canadian nationalist logic without impairing it.

Picturing Anonymity: An Empowering Method of Representing Gender-Based Violence 


Marta Malvina Mostardini 
 
Gender-based violence (GBV) is a pervasive global issue affecting one in three women worldwide (World Health Organization, 2021). Despite photojournalism’s potential to expose injustices and shift public perceptions, mainstream media often reinforces stereotypes that contribute to the normalization or sensationalization of GBV. In Italy, media portrayals of survivors of GBV frequently result in secondary victimization, reinforcing their stigmatization as mere victims rather than recognizing their agency and resilience. This Research-Creation Thesis introduces an innovative approach to representing GBV, empathizing survivor collaboration and anonymity. The core of this work is a set of guidelines, titled “Empowering Anonymity: A Visual Method of Representing Gender-Based Violence” designed for photojournalists, journalists, and those seeking to challenge the stereotypical portrayal of GBV. These guidelines outline ethical practices for engaging with survivors and anti-violence organizations in Italy, focusing on visual techniques to protect their identities. The guidelines are exemplified by a prototype photo essay, “Fragments of Self”, which demonstrates how picturing anonymity can convey fragments of a person’s identity without fully revealing who they are. This prototype is conceptualized through trauma-informed journalism practices and Pierosara’s theory of ‘fragments of violence,’ which suggests that presenting partial glimpses of a survivor’s experience can convey the essence of their story while respecting their privacy and dignity (Pierosara, 2019). By implementing these guidelines and exploring the prototype photo essay, the thesis aims to contribute to ethical practices in photojournalism, inspire survivors of GBV to share their stories, and challenge stereotypes. Ultimately, it seeks to contribute to the empowerment journey of survivors.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Influence of Low- versus High-Threat Fear Appeals on Advertisement Believability for Eco-Friendly Fashion Brands: Exploring the Moderating Effects of Message Framing and Consumer Involvement</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mukherjee Nath, Swananya</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Despite the widespread prevalence of greenwashing and escalating consumer skepticism in the sustainability sector, limited research exists on identifying ways to enhance the believability of eco-friendly fashion brands’ communications. This gap is critical, especially given the need to promote such brands, considering the harmful environmental and health effects of unsustainable fashion practices. The current research aims to address this gap by investigating the interplay of fear appeal threat level, message framing, and consumer message involvement on message believability, which is critical in shaping consumer attitudes and purchase intentions toward eco-friendly fashion brands. Through a pre-test and two online experiments, the results suggest that high-threat fear appeals are likely to increase advertising message believability compared to low-threat fear appeals (Study 2). Additionally, it was found that in the low-threat condition, there was a slight preference for promotion-focused advertisements over prevention-focused ones in terms of believability (Study 1). Furthermore, in instances of low-threat fear appeals, heightened consumer involvement might enhance the believability of advertising messages (Study 2). The study also explores the downstream effects of message believability on consumer attitudes and purchase intentions (Study 2). This study investigates the persuasive power of fear appeals in the realm of eco-friendly fashion, identifying cues to enhance message believability and offering actionable strategies for marketers to address consumer skepticism. Furthermore, it proposes strategies to augment the effectiveness of governmental campaigns aimed at encouraging more sustainable consumption habits within the fashion industry.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Code similarity detection has many practical applications, such as intellectual property protection, vulnerability search, and malware detection. However, existing approaches typically focus on the source code, while many third-party  libraries are released in bytecode format. Hence, developers may unknowingly use third-party libraries without knowing possible license violations or vulnerabilities. In this thesis, we introduce a deep learning approach, ByClone, to detect source code clones based on Java bytecode. We collect source-code level clone data for bytecode in 140 Android applications to conduct the experiments. We find that ByClone is effective in detecting code clones based on bytecode, with a precision and recall of 78.37 and 75.24. After obfuscating the bytecode, ByClone still has a precision and recall of 82.55 and 70.95, highlighting the potential of ByClone. Finally, we find that ByClone is not sensitive to different obfuscation options. Our study highlights the potential of clone detection based on bytecode. We also release the data for future research in this direction.</etd_ms:description>

Outliers detection based on quantiles and depth functions

Outlier detection plays a crucial role in data analysis and is employed in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and anomaly detection. This thesis presents a novel approach for detecting outliers using quantiles and depth functions, and we apply it to an air quality dataset. Quantiles provide a statistical measure of the distribution of data, while depth functions assess the centrality of observations relative to the entire dataset. Combining these two techniques, we propose a robust
and effective method to identify outliers in multidimensional datasets. Our approach is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional outlier detection methods may be inadequate or fail to capture the complex patterns present in the data. By considering multiple quantiles, we can identify outliers that deviate from different aspects of the data distribution. 
Additionally, we incorporate depth functions, which measure the centrality of observations within a dataset, to further refine our
outlier detection process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a real-world air quality dataset. 
The data is about the New York Air Quality Measurements of 1973 for five months from May to September recorded daily. It contains 153 observations of 6 variables. By applying our method, we can identify outliers representing unusual air quality patterns, potentially
indicating anomalies or errors in the data collection process. 
Our experimental findings support the proposed approach and effectively detect outliers in the air quality dataset. 
Compared to traditional outlier detection techniques, our method achieves higher accuracy and provides more detailed in sights into the nature of the outliers.
 Furthermore, we show that the identified outliers can be
valuable in understanding the factors contributing to air pollution and in improving the quality of air quality monitoring systems. 
The findings of this research contribute to the advancement of
outlier detection methodologies and provide valuable insights for practitioners in identifying and handling outliers in real-world applications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The aim of this work is to define modular forms modulo p and to present a result about their structure adopting two perspectives. First we deal with the case of the full modular group and we see modular forms in the classical sense through their q-expansions. In
order to generalize their characterization to level N we approach another, more intrinsic, definition of modular forms which arises from the geometry of elliptic curves. Following the work of Katz they are either functions on classes of elliptic curves with additional
data, or sections of line bundles over the modular curve. The only modular form whose q-expansion is 1 is the Hasse invariant A. Multiplication by A does not change q-expansions and naturally determines a filtration on the graded algebra of modular forms. The main theorem analyzes the properties of such a filtration through the behaviour of the operator θ whose construction represents the core of this thesis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In the 1980s the Canadian mining industry began a process of global expansion, transforming into a world-leading industry that tapped into mineral resources on virtually every continent. Many scholars associate this development with the economic changes brought about by Structural Adjustment, which opened large swathes of the planet to foreign investment, but there is a much longer history of Canadian mining abroad. This thesis explores the Imperial roots of the mining industry through an analysis of a lesser-known mining project undertaken by a McGill geologist in the late 1930s, the much-mythologized Williamson Diamond Mine of Tanzania. The Williamson Diamond Mine provided invaluable industrial material during the Second World War, eventually becoming one of the most technologically advanced schemes in British Africa. The mine hosted a unique community of Canadian and European experts tasked with operating that technology while supervising the much larger African workforce, a situation reflected in the segregated, racial division of labor and associated investment in security of the mine, which still haunts contemporary Canadian mining projects. By locating the origins of Canada’s global mining industry in colonial Africa —and the life trajectory of Williamson himself —this thesis also aims to draw attention to the unstable yet durable transnational connections that linked different sites within the British Empire, Canada and Tanzania, through decolonization and past the Cold War period. In the process, this work sets out to make a contribution to Canadian Global History that highlights the importance of further study into Canada-Africa relations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Novel Thermal Controller for Active Stabilization of Microring Modulators</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Musat, Daniel</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The bandwidth of electrical interconnects is reaching a bottleneck, leading to a surge of interest in silicon photonic interconnects. Microring modulators (MRM) are particularly attractive because of their high bandwidth, energy efficiency, and small size. However, implementing MRMs in commercial products is challenging due to their high thermal sensitivity caused by their high thermo-optic coefficient. Control systems that actively stabilize MRM have demonstrated the ability to compensate for thermal fluctuations, but none have addressed all system requirements for large-scale commercial applications. This work presents a simple and calibration-free method to stabilize MRM that can potentially fulfill all system prerequisites.

The proposed thermal controller requires a double-bus microring resonator (MRR) to monitor the through and drop averages and lock the operation where the through and drop power outputs are identical. This operating point has been shown to be within 3 \% of the optimal optical modulation amplitude (OMA), making it an excellent operating point. Furthermore, this controller is proven to be immune to any external perturbations and requires only analog components. After designing and building a printed circuit board (PCB) that incorporated the proposed thermal tuner, experimental tests were conducted on the controller using an MRM. The obtained results served to validate the functionality of the controller.

Finally, in applications where MRMs have unbalanced input data, the original proposed design is demonstrated to suffer from a region of locking instead of a single operating wavelength. A modified design was then developed and validated to extend that approach to unbalanced data.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Awakening Evidence:
An Ecotouristic Translation of the Letters of Joseph François Mangin</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Méan, Jean-François</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The letters of Franco-American architect Joseph François Mangin weathered the turbulent Age of Revolutions. They include eyewitness accounts of key moments in Haitian and American history, and details of his influential work as an architect in New York City. There are also yet unverified claims that testify to his work on the Erie Canal and drawing the plans for the city of Chambly, and its neighboring canals in Quebec, Canada. The letters testify to the transnational existence of a man who played an active role in designing New World structures and to the debates and conflicts that bore upon such activities at the time.
I will use the opportunity of translating the letters to develop an ecotouristic approach geared toward conservation of the foreign past. One that provides an aesthetic experience rooted in the present, and that privileges conservation by endeavoring to work at the crossroads of history and translation.
The recent foregrounding of time in Translation Studies led me to reconsider it as a variable in research foregrounding space. This led me to reconsider the metaphor of travel developed by Susan Bassnett, in order to ponder the ethics of mediating temporalities, and the potential of time travel as a sub-metaphor to discuss the negotiation thereof. The form employed by the author, the context of the translation itself, led me to revisit Bella Brodzki’s reflections on translation as intergenerational transmission and develop the sub-metaphor of letter-writing, to ponder how one generation answers another. 
The untranslatable past manifests in the letters as terms and expressions no longer applicable, expressions specific to the culture and idiom of the time, and idiosyncrasies inherent to a man of that time—all of which lend the text undeniable authenticity. Efforts were made to manifest these elements in a text recast in the present, by featuring loan words, and annotations intended to host the foreign past. Paratexts were added by later generations, when the letters were transcribed, to guide the reader; because the translation is for Joseph François Mangin’s African-American descendants, their reshaping also required careful consideration. 
This translation and its commentary emphasize the translator’s role as mediator of temporalities, the intergenerational nature of the endeavor and its potential for agency and conservation. They are intended to contribute to research in the translation of historical texts possessing literary qualities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Machine learning, Deep learning, Learning algorithm, Convolutional neural network</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis introduces an improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that selectively excludes irrelevant elements from input vectors to extract distinct features. The model employs Convolution (Conv) to encode data information and Deconvolution (Deconv) layers to reconstruct the spatial dimensions of feature maps and utilizing shortcut connections to exploit applicable sparsity and capture comprehensive and detailed information. This research addresses the limitations of the traditional SoftMax Loss function, which tends to overfit by wrongly classifying due to shortage of discriminability through integrating a regularization technique to the conventional Cross-Entropy loss and introducing an adaptive-margin to the standard SoftMax function. The adjusted SoftMax Loss is designed to enhance the separation of different embedding vectors and tighten clusters of similar ones. This adjustment results in boosting both the diversity between different classes and the similarity within the same class. These modifications aim to elevate the proposed model’s accuracy, and evaluations are benchmarked against existing methods using well-known datasets such as CIFAR10 , MNIST, and SVHN. Lastly, the application of the model is fine-tunned in the domain of facial expression recognition (FER). This work asserts the model's advanced capabilities over state-of-the-art methods in FER and demonstrated its effectiveness through superior accuracy on three established datasets: FER-2013, RAF-DB, and CK+.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Change Orders Predictability in Construction Projects and Ways to Improve it – A Data-Driven Study</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nabipour, Nariman</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Change orders are formal modifications to the scope of construction projects and play a critical role in shaping project outcomes. However, predicting change orders early in a project's lifecycle remains challenging due to their complex nature and the diverse factors influencing their occurrence. These include project specifications, spatial properties, and the performance of involved actors. Despite extensive research in construction change order management, predictive models for change orders have received limited attention.
This study aims to address this gap by exploring the correlation between project attributes and change order occurrences. It focuses on abstract and easily accessible project attributes such as project type and spatial features, which are more readily shared across the industry. A new set of attributes, derived from domain knowledge, is introduced to quantify project-specific change performance and enhance the prediction of change severity. 
The study also tackles the challenge of change timing prediction by modeling the temporal dependence of change orders. Using a Markov Chain approach, it simplifies the relationship between change orders issued in different project phases, assuming each phase’s outcome depends solely on the preceding phase. The validity of this assumption is tested through the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation across projects of varying durations. 
Results demonstrate a 15% improvement in change severity prediction performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the introduced attributes and feature selection techniques. The findings also confirm the suitability of the Markov Chain model for capturing temporal dependencies in change orders’ severity, offering valuable insights for early change prediction and better project planning.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Assessment of Mobility Trends and Transportation-related Emissions in Canadian Cities during the Post-COVID-19 Pandemic Period</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Naderi, Saba</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>There were some new characteristics of urban transportation in the later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated the transportation-related emissions in major cities of Canada during the post-COVID-19 pandemic period, with a focus on evolving transportation behaviors and environmental effects. The analysis was based on data collected from various provinces in Canada, encompassing greenhouse gases (GHGs), traffic volume, fuel consumption by vehicles and airlines, and air quality. The aviation sector nearly reverted to pre-pandemic levels by 2022, with significant rebounding of kerosene-type jet fuel consumption. Emission analysis from September 2020 to December 2022 showed the changes in NO2, CO, SO2, PM2.5, and O3 levels. Key observations include a gradual return to pre-pandemic emission levels. For instance, the average NO2 levels in Vancouver showed variations from 14.2 ppb in 2020 to 15.4 ppb in 2022, while average CO levels fluctuated between 0.18 ppm in 2020 and 0.22 ppm in 2022. These changes are attributed to multiple factors, including the pandemic, fuel price hikes, increased electric vehicle usage, and altered commuting patterns. The results can help further explore the mobility and emissions patterns impacted by human activities, which have implications with respect to improving air quality and reducing GHG emissions in urban areas.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Using augmented reality to improve pre-surgical decision
making among breast cancer patients</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Najafi, Niki</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Most breast cancer patients will undergo surgery as part of their treatment plan. To improve their chances of survival, they typically need to decide on their treatment plan within eight weeks of diagnosis. Patients often review post-operative images of others to gauge potential outcomes, but these images provide only limited insight into their own possible results resulting in many revision surgeries and patients who are dissatisfied with their surgical outcomes.

In this dissertation, we explore the use of augmented reality (AR) as a decision-support tool to help patients visualize different surgical procedures on their own bodies. To that end, we developed Breamy, an AR app that uses both marker-based and markerless AR visualizations. Breamy uses photogrammetry to create a patient-specific 3D model. This model, along with various treatment options, is projected directly onto the patient’s body to help visualize different surgical options. 

We surveyed 165 women on their views about the concept of Breamy and found positive results in terms of the need for such an application. We also ran a preliminary study with six participants to evaluate the usability of Breamy and its potential as a decision-aid tool. The findings of these studies suggest that AR can be an effective decision-support tool, helping to better align patient expectations with likely outcomes. For example, in our preliminary study, 90\% of participants believed that an AR application with personalized surgical information could improve patient comprehension and decision-making. Similarly, in our second study, five out of six participants reported that AR visualization enhanced their understanding of surgery's potential effects on their bodies and boosted their confidence in the decision-making process. The results of our studies underscore the potential of Breamy to transform the surgical decision-making process, ultimately leading to greater patient satisfaction and improved surgical outcomes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Archipelagos of Narratives: (Re)constructing National and Diasporic Identities in Filipino Art, From Martial Law to the Present</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>As an archipelagic nation numbering over 7,000 islands, the Philippines is home to a vast number of cultures and peoples. This diversity means that one’s identity hinged on region, language, or locale, despite the kinship these peoples have historically shared. Spanish and American colonization have only interfered in the Philippines’ heterogenous cultural landscape, which has resulted in a Westernized sense of self fractured from its precolonial and indigenous roots. The Philippines’ exposure to the global market, with foreign powers entering and overseas labourers departing, has rendered it a hotbed of cultural influences that also invites conflict and further dispersion of the country’s sense of identity. As a nation whose cultural identity has been hegemonized by Western society, Filipinx abroad and island-side struggle to piece together elements of what it means to be ‘Filipino’.
Through personal, social, and cultural excavation, Filipinx artists articulate national and diasporic qualities of Filipino identity that subvert the essentialist, colonial narratives historically imposed upon by Western powers. Anchored between martial law (1970s) and the present, I cite the works of Roberto Villanueva, Cian Dayrit, and Club Ate, who use their relationships to place in their work to critique grand narratives to unearth the stories, mythologies, and cultural practices eclipsed by history.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Assessing the Sensitivity of the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Oil Spills Through Ecosystem Services Valuation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Namazinia, Shahrzad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In recent decades, the growing demand for energy has significantly increased the volume of marine transportation and exploration, which raises the risk of marine oil spills that endanger coastal and marine ecosystems. These ecosystems provide crucial services for human well-being. The main objective of this study is to identify areas most sensitive to oil spills in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, considering the value of ecosystem services. To achieve this, four groups of ecosystem services were considered: cultural, provisioning, supporting, and regulating services. For cultural services, tourism data on marine conservation areas, historic sites, and national parks were analyzed. Provisioning services were evaluated by considering commercial fisheries and aquaculture activities. Supporting services focused on biodiversity maintenance, including seabirds and marine mammals, while regulating services were assessed by accounting for carbon sequestration and natural waste processing. The socio-economic sensitivity map was created based on the values of provisioning and cultural ecosystem services, and the biological sensitivity map was developed using regulating and supporting services. To complete the sensitivity analysis, a physical sensitivity map was also created, considering shoreline characteristics such as tidal range, wave height, slope, and cleanup cost based on the shoreline classification. The final integrated sensitivity map for the Gulf of St Lawrence was generated by combining the physical, socio-economic and biological layers. The highest sensitivity was observed along the shorelines of the Gulf, within the Estuary, and near the Anticosti Island. This study provides an integrated plan for oil spills, enabling decision makers to prioritize zones for protection before an oil spill and to optimize their cleanup efforts during an incident.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Increase in Liposome Production: From Microfluidics to Milli-fluidics</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nasr, Elie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Liposomes are tiny vesicles of lipid layers enclosing medication for drug delivery, mostly used in cancer treatment, gene therapy and mRNA vaccines. One of the production technologies implies the use of microfluidic mixers, which produce liposomes at a very low yield. Previous research proved the viability of liposome production but at a very low yield. Based on the successful results of the liposome production at micro-scale, the assumption that scaling up the channel size may lead to an increased production of similar-sized liposomes. To begin evaluating its feasibility, simulations of the mixing of two fluids within scaled up channels were carried out. The objective of the simulations are to evaluate the mixing potential prior to experimental trials. Same linear velocity values and mixing ratio were considered in simulations. However, from the mathematical model, the resulting size of the liposomes cannot be predicted. It may be possible that along with larger channels, larger liposomes might be produced. The same fluid properties will be used during the mixing of a solution containing lipids and alcohol with water, which will result in liposomes formation in both micro and milli channels. The hypothesis behind this experiment states that the size of the liposome depends on the speed of mixing, which is bounded by fluid flow properties, such as velocity, pressure and concentration, that will need to remain similar in values in the enlarged microfluidic device. During simulation, similar mixing results were obtained as the base research, which indicate good mixing efficiency when scaling up the cross-section area by 10 and 25 times.. It seems that it may be possible to increase production of liposomes through larger devices if the pressure inside the channels is increased due to higher flow rate, which is also scaled by a factor corresponding to the dimension increase. A larger production rate could be a game changer in the pharma industry. Preliminary experiments yield liposomes of increased size - by 20 to 50% in diameter at a significant increase in productivity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis titled “Ideological Narratives in Contemporary Russian War Genre Cinema” explores popular commercial films about the Second World War produced between 2018 and 2022. Through analyzing popular culture and media this study aims to build a framework of contemporary Russian war genre cinema as a tool for the promotion of Vladimir Putin’s government’s ideological rhetoric. This thesis will focus on three case studies: war genre films T-34 [T-34] (2019, dir. Alekseĭ Sidorov), Zoya [Zoi͡a] (2020, dir. Leonid Pli͡askin and Maksim Brius), and To Paris! [Na Parizh!] (2019, dir. Sergeĭ Sarkisov). Each case study will be put in conversation with other media, such as music, literature, and television, as well as genres, such as comedy, melodrama, and documentary. Building on the works of Denise J. Youngblood and Nancy Condee, I will explore how these films sponsored by the Russian government through organizations such as the Russian Military and Historical Society, Culture Fund, and state-owned TV channels represent the current imperial and nationalist ideology in the country that has contributed to the military invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  The feeling of patriotism manifested through continuous reproduction of the Second World War military history and glorified representation of the Russian characters is capitalized upon in this political context. The goal of this research is to demonstrate how these films restructure the memory of the Second World War into a commercial enterprise that actively contributes to the construction of the new Russian identity and rapid militarization of Russian society prior to and after the invasion of Ukraine.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>ESG Rating Improvements Through Mergers and Acquisitions: Do Low ESG-Rated Firms Strategically Acquire Their High ESG Rated Peers?</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Naveed, Shahmeer</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper examines the role of ESG ratings in a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) context. It attempts to answer two research questions: 1) whether mergers and acquisitions help improve the ESG performance of poorly ESG-rated acquiring companies that acquire target firms with a higher ESG ratings, and 2) whether the market places a premium on the acquisition of high ESG-rated firms. To test the related hypothesis, for our first research question, we consider the three ESG pillars (environmental, social and governance performance) along with the ESG combined score and the ESG controversies score and examine the impact of a given M&amp;A deal on ESG-ratings one year after the acquisition, in line with prior research that shows that ESG rating changes take time to be incorporated within the acquiring firm. We find mixed results: only certain ESG rating factors change after an acquisition, whereas others do not. For the second part, we estimate two types of regressions; one that focuses on deal premium and how it relates to the ESG ratings differential between the acquiring firm and the target firm, and one that relates the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) to the ESG ratings differential. In the first regression, we find significant evidence of the deal premium being positively impacted by the ESG ratings differential, while the second regression shows that the ESG ratings differential does not necessarily lead to higher CARs for acquiring firms.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Detecting Persuasion Techniques in Memes</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Memes, which are user-generated content in the form of images and text, have become a powerful medium for shaping public discourse. Given their increasing influence, detecting persuasive techniques embedded within these multimodal forms of communication is crucial for identifying propaganda and combating online disinformation. Persuasion techniques in memes often combine rhetorical elements from both text and image, creating unique challenges for computational models.

This thesis seeks to determine the impact of multimodal integration on the detection of persuasion techniques in memes and to evaluate how well multimodal models perform compared to single-modality models in this classification task. To achieve this, we developed and fine-tuned several models for text-based and multimodal persuasion detection using both pre-trained language models (BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT) and image-based models (CLIP, ResNET, VisualBERT).

A key contribution of this work is the implementation of paraphrase-based data augmentation, which helped address class imbalance and improved the performance of text-only models. For multimodal approaches, we explored both early fusion and cross-modal alignment strategies. Surprisingly, cross-modal alignment underperformed, likely due to challenges in aligning abstract textual and visual cues. In contrast, the early fusion approach of combining text and image embeddings showed the highest performance, significantly outperforming text-only and image-only models.

We also conducted zero-shot experiments with GPT-4 to benchmark its effectiveness in multimodal persuasion detection. Although GPT-4 demonstrated potential in zero-shot settings, the fine-tuned models still outperformed it, particularly when leveraging multimodal integration.

This research advances the understanding of multimodal learning for detecting persuasion techniques, with broader implications for disinformation detection in online content.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Nazarian, Fahimeh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The capability approach, as proposed by Martha Nussbaum, identifies ten capabilities that are necessary for human well-being, and suggests that governments have responsibilities to provide these capabilities to ensure a minimum threshold of justice. In some cases, however, individuals with adaptive preferences may not value these capabilities and instead sign them away. This would mark a failure of the government to provide the capabilities and ensure justice. To address this, Nussbaum legitimizes the possibility of forcing the functioning of these capabilities as one way of protecting them. However, in this paper, I argue that forcing functionings risks paternalism and is not the most effective approach to tackle adaptive preferences. I offer the idea of preparation to help the capability approach deal with adaptive preferences while avoiding paternalism.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Comprehensive Facial Attractiveness Analysis with Stacked Regression and Geometric Angles</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nezami, Kiana</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The analysis of facial beauty holds considerable importance in social interactions and has emerged as a prominent research topic in various fields. Automatic assessment of facial attractiveness has garnered significant interest due to its wide range of potential applications. This research aims to pinpoint the primary attributes contributing to beauty and assess the influence of various facial angles, such as those of the eyes, nose, lips, chin, eyebrows, and jaws. Additionally, it examines the significance of geometric facial measurements, encompassing distances between facial landmarks and ratios, in the context of beauty evaluation. The study also employs two techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and stacked regression, to predict the attractiveness of faces. The experimental data set used for evaluation is the well-known SCUT-FBP benchmark database (consisting of 500 facial images). The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which achieved the highest Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.8043 and the lowest Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of 0.3068 among all the evaluated methods. Our method incorporates six angles and leverages PCA for dimensionality reduction, along with 23 distance features, resulting in improved accuracy. Furthermore, the utilization of the stacking ensemble approach instead of individual machine learning methods contributes to the impressive performance of our method. This unequivocal success underscores the pivotal role of machine learning and pattern recognition in providing an insightful and precise assessment of facial beauty.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In 2017, Instagram introduced Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) to its platform by integrating “effects” also known as filters on social media. This innovation allows users to alter, modify, and augment their image—and, subsequently, their reality. In 2020, the app’s popularity led to the production of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Artificial Intelligence (AI) creation hub known as the Effect Gallery. Among women, one of the most popular categories of filters is beauty effects. These simulate the appearance of a makeover and include wide eyes, long eyelashes, small noses, large lips, and clear skin. Collectively, these effects simultaneously racialize and homogenize ethnic and European characteristics by simulating a racially ambiguous mask that users can employ to disguise their natural selves. Through a selective walkthrough method and a critical comparative semiotic analysis, I examine how beauty filters reinforce and perpetuate whiteness, femininity, and racial stereotypes through the illusion of beauty contributing to a colonial legacy. Furthermore, I explore how these filters affect the racialized habitus by identifying how these representations are potentially symbolically violent to Asian female diasporic users online.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Mum’s the Word: Leadership’s Role in Workplace Knowledge Hiding
Pouya Nikbakhsh
Knowledge is a critical strategic asset, yet deliberate knowledge hiding poses significant
challenges to collaboration and innovation. This thesis examines how supervisors’ rationalized
knowledge hiding influences employees’ tendencies to hide knowledge, using social learning
theory and perceived supervisor role modeling. Drawing on Leader–Member Exchange (LMX)
theory, it also explores whether high-quality supervisor–subordinate relationships moderate these
effects.
Data collected via Prolific from full-time employees across various industries were
analyzed using regression, mediation, and moderated mediation models. Findings show that
supervisors’ rationalized knowledge hiding strongly influences employees’ similar behaviors, but
not through explicit role modeling. Additionally, LMX quality did not significantly moderate
these relationships.
These results highlight the impact of leadership behaviors on workplace knowledge
dynamics. While supervisors’ direct influence is notable, role modeling and LMX alone do not
fully explain how knowledge-hiding norms spread. Organizations aiming to reduce knowledge
hiding should address supervisory behaviors and foster a culture of transparency and
collaboration.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Ce travail de recherche-création se base sur mon processus de mise en scène dans les films OK, Awareness Darkness et Été 2000 ainsi que sur l’analyse d’oeuvres et de textes féministes pour étudier des stratégies cinématographiques d’empouvoirement du corps féminin, de sa représentation et du contrôle sur son image. Ce mémoire filmique s’intéresse à des outils concrets pour performer une posture féministe-queer en tant que cinéaste en plus d’envisager la méthodologie queer comme une attitude globale, enracinée dans la résistance, dans la reprise de pouvoir et dans la réinvention des codes. Parmi les stratégies à l’étude, on retrouve la quête autoethnographique, la mise en scène féministe, la caméra subjective, les mécanismes du regard, la mémoire comme lieu, le remaniement d’archives et la réappropriation de la voix comme des techniques qui permettent un dialogue critique sur la misogynie, la violence, le consentement, la grossophobie et la santé mentale des femmes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Leak Localization in Water Distribution Networks with a Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model and Novel Distance-Based Loss Function</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nosrati Habibi, Morad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Water loss in distribution networks represents a critical challenge in urban water management, with significant environmental, economic, and public health implications. Around 126 million cubic meters of treated water are globally lost annually through distribution network leakages. This thesis presents a hybrid deep-learning approach for leakage localization that minimizes the distance between predicted and actual leak locations in water distribution networks. The developed algorithm integrates hydraulic modelling with deep learning techniques through three main phases: (1) Hydraulic Model Modification, (2) Water Demand Adjustment and Simulations, and (3) Leak Localization. A hybrid CNN-LSTM model was developed, combining CNN for spatial feature extraction and LSTM for temporal pattern recognition. Additionally, a hybrid loss function was designed to optimize both classification accuracy and distance in leak localization. The algorithm was validated using the Battle of L-Town Water Distribution Network benchmark. Results demonstrated significant improvements in localization accuracy, achieving average errors of 120.15 meters for background leakages and 98.76 meters for bursts when using the hybrid loss function - representing 29% and 39% reductions, respectively, compared to standard loss functions.  The main contributions of this thesis are two-fold: the accuracy of leakage localization has been significantly improved through the development of a hybrid CNN-LSTM model with a customized hybrid loss function, and the search area for leak identification has been reduced, with the distance-based loss function helping to minimize the physical distance between predicted and actual leak locations. This reduction in search area translates directly to decreased inspection time and costs for water utilities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Enhanced Colorectal Polyps Screening with Optimized Barlow Twins</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Notton, Cassandre</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Colorectal cancer, despite being a leading cause of cancer deaths, is also highly preventable through efficient and fast diagnosis and precancerous lesions removal. However, bottlenecks in patient screening schedules prevent proper access to rapid diagnosis and emphasize the urgent need for efficient methods, such as Deep Learning (DL) tools, to support pathologists. Nevertheless, DL models face significant challenges in computational pathology because of the gigapixel image size of whole-slide images and the scarcity of detailed annotated datasets. It is crucial to leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to alleviate the burden and cost of data annotation. However, current research lacks methods to apply SSL frameworks to analyze pathology data effectively.

We introduce a novel Barlow Twins framework, enhanced with an optimized augmentation strategy for pathology data. We leverage the KGH dataset, a private repository of colorectal polyps. We then train a Swin Transformer to exploit its hierarchical structure, effectively capturing the multi-scale nature of pathology images. These innovations improved Accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the KGH dataset and PCam dataset, a well-known challenging benchmark for classifying metastatic cancer in breast cancer patients’ lymph nodes.

Furthermore, we provide meaningful explainability insights into the performance of the different techniques. We propose a practical and impactful approach for integrating deep learning tools into pathologist clinical workflow. 

In this thesis, we demonstrate that the proposed model, relatively new to computational pathology, achieves remarkable and explainable results on various cancer types when adapted to the specific pathology task.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Moisture Diffusion and its Effect on Performance of Thermoplastic Composite Sandwich Panels with Recycled PET Foam Cores</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nouraei Ashtiani, Parinaz</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Thermoplastic composite sandwich structures represent an innovative solution in structural engineering, offering a lightweight yet durable alternative for various applications such as construction, aerospace, and automotive. These structures typically consist of two outer layers of thermoplastic composite sheets (facesheets) encapsulating a core material such as lightweight foams or honeycomb structures. Sandwich panels with recycled foam core offer a remarkable synergy between advanced engineering and sustainable practices. This study primarily focuses on the diffusion behavior of 100% recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) foam cores with four different densities (70, 80, 100, and 150 Kg/m3), Glass/ Polypropylene facesheets, and sandwich panels made of PET foam core with a density of 80 Kg/m3. All the specimens were immersed in water at a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius for prolonged durations. It is observed that the diffusion behavior of the PET foams and facesheet is governed by the classical Fick’s law. The experimental results indicated that the presence of facesheets in the sandwich structure acts as a moisture barrier and decreases the ingress of water into the composite sandwich panels by approximately 32%. The sandwich panels utilized in this investigation are manufactured using the double-belt lamination technique. To evaluate the influence of prolonged exposure to moisture on the mechanical characteristics of the structure, flatwise compression tests were conducted on the foam cores, revealing a significant decrease in compressive strength when exposed to moisture. Additionally, multiple flatwise tensile tests were conducted under both dry and wet conditions. The results revealed that wet samples demonstrate failure at the interface between the foam core and facesheet, while dry samples predominantly experience failure within the foam core. The study found that moisture exposure significantly reduced flatwise tensile strength, with bonding strength decreasing by approximately 55% after 730 hours of immersion. These findings highlight the significance of optimizing double-belt lamination parameters to have stronger and more uniform adhesion between facesheet and core under conditions of water exposure.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Nozaki Yano, Vitor Atsushi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This autoethnographic study investigates the phenomenon of critical consciousness raising, as proposed by Freire, through popular education. Situated in the critical pedagogy field, it analyzes a personal transformative experience of conscientização, to explore how critical consciousness is developed in practice through popular education, what are the factors, conditions, and dispositions that can contribute to raising critical consciousness, and what can be the consequence of critical consciousness raising to one’s life and one’s communities. For that, a quick introduction of the main theoretical concepts is presented, and a literature review of 36 autoethnographic studies on critical consciousness was conducted. Employing a narrative method of inquiry and analysis, the methods for data collection and analysis are also discussed. The main findings of the study are that dialogue and praxis are main elements in the process of developing critical consciousness in popular education; desire for change and dialogical communication aligned with practice, are required for raising critical consciousness; the consequences of the process of conscientização including greater autonomy, responsibility, and leadership, fostering collective organization and social transformation. For further research, it is recommended to expand the questions approached in this study to a greater context, employing empirical research on the processes of critical consciousness raising among different people involved in one or more popular education initiatives within a community.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) refers to a physical system that integrates control, computational and communication capabilities. Indeed, CPSs find applications in various domains, including autonomous vehicles, water distribution systems and the Internet of Things (IoT). While CPSs offer potential for enhancing traditional engineering systems, security concerns regarding cyberattacks have become prominent. A key objective for potential attackers is to remain stealthy. In this dissertation, we focus on the development of detection methods to detect intelligent and malicious adversaries in CPS. The detection methods entail intelligently designing and altering the system’s architecture to hinder adversaries from executing stealthy attacks. 
First, a novel architecture aimed at detecting replay cyberattacks is introduced. This solution is implemented by integrating a virtual auxiliary system and detection filters into the automated control system. The incorporated filters effectively isolate replay cyberattacks from other forms of adversaries. Furthermore, our solution demonstrates proficiency in maintaining the closed-loop performance of the system.
Second, a novel method for detecting Pole Dynamic Attack (PDA), is proposed. The adverse effects of PDA attacks on a CPS are analyzed. To tackle this issue, the physical system is enhanced by adding an auxiliary system on the plant side and its duplicate, along with incorporating detection filters into the command and control Center. Furthermore, our novel defense mechanism exhibits robustness in detecting PDA attacks across diverse levels of attacker knowledge and capabilities.
In conclusion, the exploration of enhancing the security of CPS by intelligently adjusting the system’s architecture to hinder an adversary’s ability to carry out stealthy attacks is presented in this thesis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring Alternative Pain Management Methods: Challenges and Concerns in Athletes and Women during Labor</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nudo, Stefania</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis reports the results of a Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis, and a research study. The Systematic Review compared the efficacy of topical versus oral medications to a placebo in athletes. A meta-analysis was conducted calculating Hedges’ g and forest plots with 95% CI were created. There was a significant pooled effect size indicating a reduction in pain for the topical medication compared to the placebo, but not for the oral medication compared to the placebo.  The conclusion was that topical medication was more effective for pain reduction than oral medication amongst athletes.

The research study aimed to analyze the correlation between the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Labor Pain Relief Attitude Questionnaire for pregnant women (LPRAQ-p), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and pain measured on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Women were asked to fill out the PCS, the LPRAQ-p, and the EPDS in the prenatal period, and the EPDS once again in the postpartum period, along with the VAS regarding labor pain and current pain. The hypotheses were that the PCS would be correlated to pain, the LPRAQ-p, and the EPDS, and that the LPRAQ-p and the EPDS would be correlated. The only significant correlations amongst the questionnaires were the prenatal EPDS being correlated to the postpartum VAS, and the prenatal and postpartum EPDS being correlated. A secondary exploratory analysis showed that EPDS scores were higher amongst nulliparous women compared to multiparous women, and that the LPRAQ-p was higher in women who received analgesia.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In this paper, I aim to enrich scholarship on Georg Fredrich Meier and extend scholarship on Immanuel Kant’s critique of speculative metaphysics. Meier is a relatively underexamined philosopher who worked within the eighteenth-century Wolffian tradition of Rationalism and influenced Kant’s critical philosophy. Meier was critical of the metaphysical claims of the Rationalist school, particularly in his essay Thoughts on the State of the Soul after Death. Meier aimed his critique at Rational Psychology, which boasted proofs for the existence of the immortal soul and claims of certainty regarding its substantiality, simplicity, and maintenance of personality after death. Famously, in the Paralogisms section of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant also critiques speculative metaphysics and claims about the qualities of the soul. In the Paralogisms, Kant directs his critique toward Rational Psychology but does not refer directly to the fallacious arguments of the Wolffian tradition of Rational Psychology. Kant’s avoidance of mentioning the Wolffian tradition has led to some degree of scholarly neglect for this essential context. I will argue that both Kant and Meier are critics of Rational Psychology who levy the same kind of argument against the claims of Rational Psychology: both argue that proof of the claims about the soul are beyond the capacities of human reason to obtain. In targeting the ground of these claims, the capacities of human reason itself, both Kant and Meier make room for faith, despite differing on the degree to which that faith is necessary for morality.</etd_ms:description>

Grave Matters: Mapping the Untold Stories of the 
Saint-Colomban Cemetery

Kelley O’Rourke

This research undertakes a deep exploration of the Saint-Colomban cemetery in Québec, aiming to unveil the hidden stories within its burial grounds. While the first settlers arrived from Ireland as early as 1819, my primary focus centers on the years 1836–1847, mirroring the establishment of Saint-Colomban Parish and Cemetery in 1836. The primary objective is to bridge historical gaps in the Irish diaspora, spotlighting the significance of these absent markers in shaping the cultural narrative of the Irish community within the Saint-Colomban cemetery. Specifically, the research seeks to identify missing names using parish records, exploration of broken gravestones, undecipherable markings and meanings behind some of the epitaphs. Through this detailed research approach, preservation challenges encountered during the research process emerged as crucial elements, contributing essential insights to the broader historical picture. By incorporating oral histories from descendants, this study not only breathes life into the cemetery's historical narrative but also uncovers personal stories overlooked in traditional historical accounts. Through the combination of visual representations such as existing headstones and parish records, interviews with descendants, and mapping the cemetery layout, the research provides a comprehensive understanding of the missing monuments, their cultural significance, and the preservation challenges encountered with their discovery. This research goes beyond the surface, to uncover the missing monuments and their hidden stories, offering a meaningful perspective on the Irish diaspora in Canada. The focus on uncovering these gaps in history not only enriches our understanding of the past but also paves the way for a more inclusive and complete narrative of the Irish community in the Saint-Colomban parish.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Conditional cooperation is the tendency to cooperate if and only if others cooperate. This paper aims to ascertain the importance of conditional cooperation and the effect of perceived corruption and cultural environments on individuals’ behaviors in the public goods games in a public game by replicating the seminal Fischbacher et al. (2001) experiment and comparing results between Nigeria and Canada.  This thesis proposes to explore the reliability of classifying participants into distinct behavioral types – such as conditional cooperators, free riders, and triangular contributors – based on their contribution patterns. Additionally, a post-experiment questionnaire – which is modified based on the European Social Survey (ESS), Value Survey Model (VSM, 2013), and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) National Survey on Quality and Integrity of Public Services – is employed to explore how individuals in both countries perceive their cultural and socio-economic differences, and how perceptions, particularly regarding corruption, influence their cooperative behavior and contributions to public goods.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Microstructure, Mechanical, and Tribological Evaluation of Carbide-Based Wear-Resistant Coatings for Aerospace Applications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ogunmola, Oluwadamilola</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Thermally sprayed tribological coatings are extensively employed in aerospace applications to address critical issues including corrosion, erosion, oxidation, abrasive wear, and fatigue under different service conditions. Besides addressing these difficulties, these coatings are essential for improving the efficiency of gas turbine engines, thereby decreasing fuel consumption and emissions.
High Velocity Air-Fuel (HVAF) thermal spraying has become a promising method for producing carbide-based tribological coatings, offering significant advantages over other techniques such as Air Plasma Spray (APS) process. Its higher particle velocity and lower flame temperature result in denser coatings with reduced oxide content and enhanced hardness. These properties make HVAF an ideal method for developing advanced coatings that can effectively resist surface degradation caused by wear, corrosion, and erosion, even under extreme temperatures.
The objective of our research work is to investigate the tribological properties of thermally sprayed carbide-based coatings deposited by plasma spray and high velocity air fuel deposition processes. This work consists of two research studies, the first emphasize the influence of deposition processes (i.e., APS and HVAF) and binder content (i.e., pure carbide and cemented carbide) on the microstructural, mechanical, and tribological behavior of chromium carbide-based coatings at room temperature and 450 °C. The second study is a preliminary work that evaluates the microstructure of pure silicon carbide coatings deposited by suspension plasma spraying process.
The tribological test was performed using a ball-on-flat tribometer and the wear profiles were obtained using a laser confocal microscope. The Ex-situ characterization of the as-deposited coatings were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), image analysis, and the Vickers microhardness test was performed on the cross-sections of the coatings at room temperature. The HVAF sprayed Cr₃C₂-25NiCr coating deposited with the 4L4 nozzle exhibits the lowest friction and improved wear resistance compared to all the tested APS coatings at room temperature and 450°C. Moreover, the second study has demonstrated that pure SiC coatings can be produced using suspension plasma spray (SPS) process and open pathway for future development of ceramic materials which are prone to decomposition.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Data-driven Security Monitoring System for Cyberattacks on SSDCs in DFIG-Based Wind Parks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Oladi, Zeinab</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The massive integration of wind parks (WPs) in the modern power grid resulted in a significant concern regarding the security of the entire grid. These concerns are more important in the presence of WPs with inherent stability issues, e.g., when doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) are connected to series-compensated transmission systems. This thesis presents a novel real-time, data-driven security monitoring system to detect false data injection (FDI) and denial of service (DoS) cyberattacks targeting the subsynchronous damping controller (SSDC) in DFIG-based WPs.

A detailed and realistic electromagnetic transient (EMT) model of a DFIG-based WP is developed, along with the design of an SSDC to mitigate the subsynchronous control interaction (SSCI) phenomenon. The cyber vulnerabilities within the WP system, based on IEC 61400 standards, are analyzed to identify potential attack vectors in its cyber layer. It is demonstrated that such attacks can render the performance of SSDC ineffective, resulting in instability and sustained oscillations. To counter these issues, a real-time security monitoring system leveraging a customized recurrent neural network (RNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) networks model is proposed to identify FDI and DoS attacks against the SSDC. The performance of the developed RNN-LSTM model is benchmarked against well-known classifiers, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating superior detection accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed model is further validated using unseen data, ensuring its effectiveness and generalization capability. Additionally, the proposed model exhibits low latency, making it suitable for near real-time operations in WPs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>research-creation, performance art, performative photography, transformation and agency, identity, the political body, Latinx and Latin American feminist art</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis employs a research-creation methodology to examine the relationship between an artist and their body as experienced through the multifaceted role of identity. It responds to the role of agency in artmaking through the practice of performative photography while developing a series of works featuring dynamic images of the body in motion. The study examines the history of movement in photography, interpreting aesthetic outcomes and contemplation of performing for the camera. With a feminist/ethnic (Other) lens, the art practices of four performance artists from Cuba, Chile, and Colombia are explored, and their artistic approaches are observed through themes of exile, the political body, the collective body, and ritual. The research is carried out while considering how this author’s work is impacted by her identity and lived experience. The studio inquiry discusses the exhibition titled Impulse: A Photographic Exhibition on The Articulation of Becoming, where this work was presented. As a research-creation, it employs performative photography to analyze the transformative ability of art that connects the self to the collective narratives. Themes of identity and selfhood, as well as notions of the body in art, can be valuable creative access points in the domain of art education, demonstrating that art as pedagogy can bridge knowledge across disciplines, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of our socio-cultural contexts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Detection of Counterfeit Coins Using Multimodal GPT-4 and Vision Transformer</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Omidvar Tehrani, Dina</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The proliferation of counterfeit coins poses a substantial threat to the integrity of monetary systems and the stability of financial markets. Advanced counterfeiting techniques allow these fraudulent coins to closely mimic genuine ones, complicating the detection process and necessitating robust methods capable of discerning minute differences between genuine and fake coins. This thesis addresses the problem of counterfeit coin detection by introducing a diverse dataset comprising high-resolution images of both Danish and Chinese coins, categorized into genuine and counterfeit sets across multiple years.
To tackle the detection task, we employ two advanced approaches: a Vision Transformer (ViT) model and a multimodal GPT-4 model. The ViT model leverages its self-attention mechanisms to capture intricate patterns and details within the coin images, while the GPT-4 model integrates both visual and textual data, utilizing various prompting techniques to enhance its performance. Our results show that the ViT model outperforms previous methods and the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and robustness, achieving a remarkable 99.31% accuracy. The GPT-4 model, although primarily designed for natural language processing, demonstrates promising capabilities in counterfeit detection, particularly with advanced prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Generated Knowledge.
This research advances the current state-of-the-art in counterfeit coin detection and highlights the potential of few-shot learning and transfer learning in achieving high accuracy with limited training data.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Tracing Transhistorical Girlhood Through Sofia Coppola’s Filmic Adaptations</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Oort, Lucy</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis proposes adaptation studies as a productive, yet vastly overlooked, framework through which to contextualize the work of American filmmaker Sofia Coppola. A substantial number of Coppola’s films are adapted from both fictional novels and non-fiction texts, and approach conditions of contemporary girlhood from the context of varying geo-political and historical stories, events, and figures. This sparks an exploration of Coppola’s signature cinema of girlhood as transhistorical, as the filmmaker transposes, re-creates, and reinterprets stories of women and girls from the past through her own contemporary perspective. The first chapter looks at The Virgin Suicides (1999), an adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides’ 1993 novel, and the reinterpretation of central narrative devices which transform a male-narrated story into a portrait of nostalgic girlhood. The second chapter looks at Marie Antoinette (2006), adapted from Antonia Fraser’s 2001 biography, Marie Antoinette: The Journey. I position the film’s anachronistic costumes and musical soundtrack as derivative of the adaptation process; not only working to situate the story of Marie Antoinette in recognizable, contemporary themes, but also reflecting Fraser’s sympathetic and subjective approach to her biography. The third chapter looks at The Beguiled (2017) as both an adaptation of Thomas Cullinan’s 1966 novel and a remake of Don Siegel’s 1971 film. I examine Coppola’s reinterpretation of the story’s perspective and sympathy through the gender dynamic on-screen, while addressing what remains off-screen: Coppola’s controversial decision to omit the novel’s original Black characters. This research positions adaptation studies as necessary to a comprehensive understanding of the filmmaker’s oeuvre, demonstrating the intertwinement of Coppola’s signature theme of girlhood and her evocation of adapted period narratives. This results in a recurring theme of transhistorical girlhood in Coppola’s films, through which the filmmaker repeatedly forms portraits of young women through transposed, palimpsestic stories and figures of the past.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Rogers-Shephard Type Inequality for Surface Area</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ounissi, Fadia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The famous Rogers-Shephard inequality states that, for any convex body \(K \subset \mathbb R^n\), we have a volumetric inequality \(V_n(K-K) \leq \binom{2n}{n}V_n(K)\) that compares the volume of the difference body of $K$, \(K-K\), with the volume of $K$. Using Cauchy's surface area formula, a particular case of the more general {\it{Kubota's Formulae for Quermassintegrals}}, we extend this classical inequality to extrapolate an upper bound \(C_K=\frac{S(K-K)}{S(K)}\) for the surface area of the difference body within the Euclidean space \(\mathbb R^n\). We accompany this upper bound with a lower bound that we derive from the classical Brunn-Minkowski inequality, \(V_n(A+B)^{1/n} \geq V_n(A)^{1/n}+V_n(B)^{1/n}\). Embracing a geometric perspective, we delve into the nuanced relationships between convex bodies and their respective surface areas, scrutinizing the patterns and properties of the difference body. This includes the validation of the upper bound in \(\mathbb R^3\) for certain classes of convex bodies, including smooth bodies and polytopes. We then analyse and establish a pattern for the formation of the difference body of pyramidal structures in \(\mathbb R^3\). Finally, we draw a conclusion on the effect of symmetry on \(C_K\)'s proximity to either bound. More specifically, we observe how deviations from symmetry, mainly when \(K\) is a simplex, often considered the most asymmetric convex body, draws the constant closer to the upper bound.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Palakode Raju, Sidharth</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the intricate relationship between gaming behaviors and their impact on anxiety levels and life satisfaction among gamers. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle comprising 13,465 participants and 55 variables, the study employs both logistic and probabilistic regression analyses to examine how various demographic, behavioral, and sociocultural factors influence mental health outcomes in gamers. The regression models identify significant predictors for different anxiety and satisfaction with life classes, highlighting the roles of factors like gender, employment status, reason for playing, and gaming hours.

The findings underscore the pervasive nature of anxiety and its negative impact on life satisfaction. High levels of anxiety often overshadow positive experiences, leading to diminished well-being. The study also highlights the importance of focusing on interventions based on which factors have the most significant effect on these mental health concerns under study, suggesting that strategies to reduce anxiety and enhance life satisfaction should consider demographic differences and specific gaming behaviors. Despite the reliance on self-reported data and potential sample biases, the research provides valuable insights for developing targeted mental health interventions for the gaming community.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Investigating motor memory formation and consolidation is a central endeavor of contemporary neuroscience as it helps to understand motor skill learning as well as how to treat its related deficits. Evidence from the current research shows that a short exposure to a motor skill learning task creates modifications in the neurophysiological and hemodynamical processes in the task-related brain areas which are considered as formation of new memory representations. These modifications occur mainly through excitatory-inhibitory synaptic changes which are partly associated with the modulation of glutamate (the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system). Memory representations are susceptible to interference and can be diminished easily unless protected by a subsequent nap or overnight sleep in which the task-related neuronal activity will reappear and elicit plasticity. Eventually, behavioral enhancement can be expected after memory consolidation. 
To further explain the motor skill learning in terms of the task-induced electrical, hemodynamic and metabolite activity of the human brain, we conducted a non-invasive study using multimodal brain imaging techniques under a motor sequence learning task whereby we could analyze the relationship between resting state spatiotemporal neuronal activity and the glutamate variations during one sleep-wake cycle. In this work, we demonstrated a conditional relationship between the dynamics of resting-state electrical activity and glutamate concentrations. This relationship was found in diurnal glutamate variations and Electroencephalography in the targeted Supplementary Motor Area in low gamma band (30-55Hz, p-value = 0.006) and overall band (0.5-55Hz, p-value = 0.014) as well as other motor network areas.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>screen time management, digital affordances, smartphones, consumer well-being</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>The pervasive integration of smartphones into daily life has reshaped how individuals engage with technology, presenting opportunities and challenges for screen time management. This research explores the dual nature of smartphone affordances through the lens of affordance theory, focusing on how these devices support user’s objectives but also hinder their well-being. The study examines individual's digital habits through interpretive analysis of the data, which consists of semi-structured, in-depth interviews with twelve participants aged 23 to 54 recruited from social media platforms. From understanding the initial benefits to potential negative impacts due to overuse, the study provides a nuanced understanding of how smartphone affordances can contribute to adverse outcomes. The research identifies key objectives driving smartphone use: self-care, information, communication, entertainment, and companionship. It explores how these objectives can lead to negative effects, explored as physical, emotional, and behavioural precipitating elements. It proposes curtailment strategies, including self-restraint, self-surveillance, network management, and other non-digital strategies. The theoretical contributions include an enhanced conceptualization of affordances in digital consumption and disconnection, demonstrating how the same smartphone functionalities can lead to varied positive and negative experiences, depending on usage. This paper offers practical insights for stakeholders to develop, promote, and implement effective screen time management strategies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Applicability of a Machine Learning Methodology to Generate TMY Weather Files</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Papakyriakou, Ashleigh Marie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>TMY Weather File, Building Energy Simulation, Energy Modeling</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>To effectively decarbonize buildings accurate energy models must be created to predict building energy performance. Typical meteorological year (TMY) weather files represent long-term weather conditions and are used in energy modelling to help evaluate energy performance. This thesis explores generating TMY files using machine learning to improve accuracy, which can significantly influence energy simulation results. The current TMY generation approach relies on expert judgment, often overlooking seasonal, climate and application-based variations.
Manuscript #1 introduces a machine learning methodology using feature importance to determine the relevant generation parameters used in the Sandia method to enhance the current TMY generation approach. The proposed methodology is applied to a medium office building in Montreal. The results reveal an improved representativeness of the long-term average building energy demand for the TMY generated using the proposed methodology.
Manuscript #2 aims to (1) assess the applicability of the methodology across Canadian climates; (2) investigate the feasibility of using standardized climate zone-based weighting factors to reduce the computational time associated with extracting location-based weighting factors to facilitate wider adoption of the proposed methodology. The methodology is applied to 18 cities across six Canadian climate zones and generates two weather files for each location. TMYSTATION uses location-based weighting factors while TMYCZ uses climate zone-based weighting factors. The CV(RMSE) and NMBE indicate the proposed weather files outperform the conventional weather files in predicting the long-term energy performance of buildings. Although the TMYSTATION files performed marginally better, the convenience of standardized climate zone-based weighting factors can enhance the methodology’s adaptability.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>“What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done for food?” Cordova girl Myra asks protagonist Kora in Larissa Lai’s novel The Tiger Flu. Myra’s question does not simply demand an answer at the individual level within a fictional narrative, but needs to be extended to actual food systems. What is it that we do in order to consume beings as food? The novel’s fictional food systems reflect the nonfictional ones where the forms of life humans eat and call food are often understood as product rather than beings with whom we are in relation. Such treatment is based on the assumption that the human body is a system with fixed boundaries separating it from other species, and that reason makes humans an exceptional species. Against these beliefs, I argue that those made into food can be understood as kin rather than product. I read this relational ontological mode throughout Lai’s novel where food circulation, ingestion, and zoonosis indicate a range of ways bodies infiltrate one another despite rigid policing. I examine practices of food preservation and social control in The Tiger Flu as forms of containment that separate human subjects from commodified, racialized, and dehumanized others. Containment is challenged by characters’ becoming-with those they eat and those with whom they share meals. When the first category bleeds into the second, consumption becomes cannibalism. I show that the novel not only denounces capitalist relations for which cannibalistic eating is a model but also proposes the alternative paradigm of relational cannibalism where eating is an act of trans-corporeal integration maintaining kinship beyond death.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The Expedition is a novel that follows teenagers Duncan and Rose in the walled city of Dreslin. Both teens struggle to conform to the roles placed on them by their gender and class. Duncan, the scrawny son of poor factory workers, runs away to join an expedition beyond the city’s walls in an attempt to affirm his masculinity. Rose, the eldest daughter of a family precariously balanced on the periphery of the city’s elite, feels stifled by the expectations placed upon her to “secure” her family’s position through marriage. She begins to question the hierarchies she’s lived under her entire life. 
	Duncan’s expedition and his attempts to embody the stoic masculinity his city valorizes are both abject failures. Amidst an ever-mounting pile of bodies, Duncan comes to question and eventually rejects the values that caused him to sign up in the first place. 
	Parallel to Duncan’s expedition, Rose watches a full-scale workers' revolt, violently put down by the very powers that keep her family comfortable. While her engagement with the revolt is initially filtered through the windows of her family home in the wealthy part of the city, she, much like Duncan, eventually witnesses the violence of her society firsthand. While washing blood from her hair, Rose realizes that the only moral thing to do is to rebel. The novel tackles topics of class struggle, gender roles, and the fascist weaponization of toxic masculinity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Pedro Almodóvar</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Ce mémoire de maîtrise propose une analyse narratologique de l’univers filmique almodóvarien à partir des relations entre deux aspects importants de la filmographie du cinéaste : les dédoublements ainsi que son utilisation complexe des niveaux narratifs.
	M’appuyant principalement sur le travail théorique de Gérard Genette et de Christian Metz sur la diégèse, je démontrerai que ces dédoublements, lorsqu’à l’intérieur d’un même film, agissent comme motifs pour assurer une cohésion formelle tout en soulignant les enjeux thématiques et narratifs de l’œuvre. Les dédoublements intertextuels entre les films d’Almodóvar, quant à eux, forment un univers dans lequel les frontières entre les niveaux narratifs sont si ambiguës qu’il en devient impossible d’en déterminer la structure exacte. Ce constat suggère que l’univers almodóvarien est, un peu à la manière des Drawing Hands de M.C. Escher ou du 8 1/2 de Fellini, une grande mise abyme aporétique : elle se met continuellement en scène en train de se mettre en scène, dans le but de remettre en question notre vision du monde et de se forcer à le voir d’un autre œil.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Behavioural Consultation in Preschool Settings for Children with Behavioural Difficulties: Two Case Studies</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Pastras, Irene</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Approximately 5%-20% of preschool children exhibit significant challenging behaviours within the classroom, stemming from underlying behavioural or emotional difficulties (Campbell, 1995; Charach et al., 2020). However, most early childhood educators do not feel supported or equipped to handle these challenging behaviours due to a lack of training and resources, low confidence, and a growing pressure to perform (Arnold et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2017). This qualitative research study investigated the impact of implementing Behavioural Consultation (Kratochwill &amp; Bergan, 1990) in preschool classrooms to support educators who intervened with children with behaviour challenges. Collaborative meetings with educators over the course of 10 weeks were implemented to investigate changes in educators’ knowledge of children’s behavioural needs, educators’ knowledge of appropriate strategies, educators’ self-efficacy, and children’s display of challenging behaviours. Findings from pre- and post- intervention interviews, questionnaires, and child observations were analysed. Thematic coding revealed that preschool educators’ experiences with the consultation process partially improved their self-efficacy when they used more developmentally appropriate behaviour strategies that positively impacted the children’s behaviours. Educators’ use of positive behavioural strategies matched the children’s developmental and individual needs and served to improve the educators’ perceptions of the children. These findings have implications for designing professional development programs in preschool settings to support educators who intervene with children with behavioural difficulties.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Procreation and Sacrament as Valued Goods of Marriage: Re-Evaluating the Foundational Principles of the Catholic Marriage Tradition in the Secular Contemporary Western World</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The foundation of the Catholic marriage tradition is deeply Christological and ecclesiastical. The tradition today continues to stress that spouses must be joined in Holy Matrimony, wherein newlyweds are married in a religious ceremony held in a church and exchange the sacrament of marriage. The appeal of the Catholic marriage tradition, however, has become strained among both Christians and non-Christians in the contemporary Western world. Marriage is now a private social or legal contract between consensual partners, and the sacramental model of marriage that chiefly encouraged indissolubility, heterosexual unions, and childrearing is largely ignored in current civil marriage laws. Marriage practice has also developed many secular alternatives in favor of individualism. While some might rightfully argue that there is an ongoing need for reform within Catholic churches regarding its enduring marriage customs, there is, on the other hand, a legitimate concern for the protection of the values embedded in Catholic marriage theology and law. The challenge becomes how to appropriate such biblical and ecclesiastical traditions into the more fluid contemporary Western age.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Assessing land-use legacy effects on soil physico-chemical properties and earthworm biodiversity in urban parks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Paulauskas, Michael</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Urban soil ecology, earthworm biodiversity</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Human land-use alters soil properties and biodiversity differently depending on the intensity and type of use, often resulting in persistent temporal effects known as legacy effects. Cities are expected to be rich in legacy effects due to their development histories and complex socio-ecological landscapes. However, few urban ecological studies consider the role of history in shaping contemporary patterns. Therefore, we asked: do soil properties and biodiversity of our present-day urban greenspaces differ due to varied historical land-use? We surveyed 25 urban parks across the island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada with three former land-uses: forested (low intensity), agricultural (medium intensity), and industrial (high intensity). We measured soil bulk density, heavy metal concentrations, and carbon and nitrogen stocks, as well as earthworm abundance, biomass, species richness, and community composition. Most studied soil properties did not differ across historical land-uses. All properties except for heavy metal concentrations significantly increased with age, implying a legacy effect of recovery from disturbance and management post park establishment. Earthworm distribution was highest in forested sites whereas earthworm biodiversity was lower in previously agricultural sites. These findings suggest that aspects of soils in our urban greenspaces are minimally susceptible to legacy effects of historical human land-use. This demonstrates a certain effectiveness in developing municipal parks on a variety of past land-uses. This could allow for a focusing on current management choices and decisions which may have a greater influence on park ecosystem functioning.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>PV, Wind and Space Heating Electrification Utilization Analysis for a Small Canadian Arctic Hybrid Microgrid</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Paulin-Bessette, Thomas</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Canadian Arctic remote communities mostly rely on diesel gensets (DGSs) to produce electricity, which is expensive and emits greenhouse gases (GHG) that pollute the environment and affect the air quality. These communities can utilize their renewable energy (RE) potential to reduce both their fuel consumption and the associated GHG emissions.
In the first part of the project, the potential of PV and wind turbines (WTs) is evaluated. The PV utilization analysis results in a contribution of nearly 22% of the yearly community energy requirement and diesel savings of up to 18% with a rated PV power of 200 kW or 125% of the community load peak power. As for the analysis of the wind system, the renewable energy contribution reaches close to 36% alongside fuel savings of 29% for three 25 kW WTs. When combining PV and WTs, the portion of energy supplied by the renewable energy (RE) system reaches 44% along with 36% fuel savings. However, when including RE to the microgrid, its penetration, or percentage of total energy provided by PV, and its associated fuel savings are limited by curtailment, to prevent the DGSs from operating with low loading.
The second part of the project evaluates the addition of electric thermal storage (ETS) to the microgrid, which allows for recycling excess (curtailed) RE production to electrify a portion of the heating requirements of the community which is currently oil-based. When pairing ETS units with WTs and PV, the RE curtailment is significantly reduced and can be lowered by up to 90% when ETS units are installed in all the houses of the considered community. Lastly, ETS units can increase the total fuel savings and associated GHG emissions by 46%, when compared to the first part of the study.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Pawelczak, Alexander Christophe</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a promising drug delivery platform as they compartmentalize bioactive payloads prior to delivery, have low immunogenicity, and are capable of tissue-specific targeting. EV-based therapeutics in most research pipelines are produced using cultured human mesenchymal stem cells. This approach is limiting as they are not amenable to complex genetic engineering, are expensive to grow and maintain, produce heterogenous EVs that are challenging to purify, and cannot be easily upscaled. Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is an excellent candidate for EV research, as it exhibits similar fundamental EV biology and may overcome these and other limitations. Using S. cerevisiae as a model, this study aims to determine if yeast strains expressing EV localization peptides can produce engineered EVs loaded with bioactive cargo. To achieve this, a panel of genetically modified yeast strains was generated to express fluorescently tagged versions of known EV markers and bioproduction was quantified with single particle analyses.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>From A Rhetoric of Ravishment to A Rhetoric of Rape:
Sir Thomas Malory’s Linguistic Shift in the Bedtricks of Le Morte Darthur</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Pereira, Lindsay</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the linguistic and narrative transformation of bedtrick scenes in Sir Thomas Malory’s Le Morte Darthur compared to their depictions in the Old French Vulgate. It investigates how Malory modifies the original sources’ romanticized portrayals of rape and deceit, shifting toward a rhetoric that aligns with his contemporary concerns, particularly regarding legitimacy and moral order. By analyzing three key bedtrick scenes – Uther and Igraine, Arthur and Morgause, and Lancelot and Elaine – this study reveals how Malory downplays the enigma and emotional justifications present in the Vulgate, opting instead for a sparser, more chronicle-like tone. This approach, as observed by scholars such as Corinne Saunders and Kathryn Gravdal, reflects a deliberate effort to sterilize and rationalize sexual violence, distancing it from the romantic glamorization typical of courtly romance. The analysis underscores that while the Vulgate blurs the boundaries between love and coercion, Malory reconfigures these narratives to serve his cultural and moral agenda, ultimately obscuring the reality of deceit, violence, and rape. The thesis concludes that despite their stylistic differences, both Le Morte Darthur and the Old French Vulgate participate in a broader literary tradition that seeks to rationalize and contain the disruptive potential of sexual transgression within the frameworks of their respective societies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Genetic interactions occur when a combination of mutations in different genes results in an unexpected phenotype based on the combined effects of individual single mutants. Synthetic lethality represents an extreme example of a genetic interaction resulting in lethal double mutant from the combination of viable single mutants. The knowledge of the genetic interactions that underlie conditional gene essentiality across species, whereby a gene which is required for viability in one species is dispensable in another has remained elusive. In this thesis, I investigated digenic interactions that underlie conditional essentiality, and the trigenic interactions that underlie conditional synthetic lethality in distantly related eukaryotes to understand the principles of genetic network conservation. First, I used literature curation to identify conditional essential genes and their synthetic lethal interactions across S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. elegans and H. sapiens. I applied functional enrichment analysis and demonstrated that conditional essential genes are rewired by functionally related and specific synthetic lethal digenic interactions. Second, I identified synthetic lethal double mutants in S. cerevisiae that were viable in S. pombe. I constructed and screened 14 conditional essential double mutants and corresponding 24 single mutant query strains using trigenic Synthetic Genetic Array (τ-SGA) to identify trigenic interactions. I found that similar to single mutants, conditional synthetic lethal double mutants were rewired by functionally related trigenic interactions. Ultimately, understanding the rewiring of gene essentiality by genetic interactions sheds light on genome evolution and synthetic lethal therapies for human disease.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The widespread use of Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) has reshaped migration. Individuals with the agency to decide on a migration destination rely on social media platforms to guide their decision-making process. While scholars have highlighted the relevance of online spaces for migrants, there is a gap in exploring which digital actors facilitate migration and the type of information conveyed to aspiring migrants. This thesis studied the role of Brazilian immigrant influencers on Instagram in building Canada's destination reputation to shape co-national destination choices to fill this gap. For this purpose, this project relied on the content analysis of 30 Instagram posts from five Brazilian immigrant influencers and ten interviews with Brazilian newcomers residing in Canada. This thesis found that influencers convey an overtly positive representation of Canada, the 'Canadian Paradise,' by sharing partial and exaggerated information that compares life in Brazil and Canada. As a second finding, newcomers shifted their views after migrating and now believe that Brazilian immigrant influencers acted guided by economic motivations. These findings indicate that Brazilian immigrant influencers are digital migration intermediaries who rely on idealized representations of Canada to promote migration-related services, which reveals the emergence of a digital migration industry.</etd_ms:description>

Durant cette période de croissance et de vulnérabilité, les adolescents et jeunes adultes peuvent avoir besoin d’un accompagnement psychologique ou psychiatrique.

Le but de cette étude était d’obtenir de la part de musicothérapeutes experts en santé mentale, leurs perspectives sur le potentiel d’application d’une méthode récente de musicothérapie réceptive, nommée Montage Audio Personnalisé (MAP) auprès d’adolescents et de jeunes adultes. Une étude qualitative d’analyse de contenu a été réalisée en utilisant un questionnaire anonyme de type sondage Qualtrics complété par les participants suite au visionnement d’une vidéo d’extraits de séances types MAP inclus avec le sondage. Les résultats obtenus ont mis en évidence la pertinence, les potentiels, les défis et les risques de la méthode MAP pour la population adolescente bénéficiant d’un soutien en matière de santé mentale. Bien que le nombre de trois participants constitue une limite, cette recherche a fourni un approfondissement et une avancée dans l’évaluation de cette méthode ouvrant la porte à des recommandations de recherches et formations futures.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Myth of Religious Violence: Applying William Cavanaugh’s Theory to
Jonestown, the Siege of Mount Carmel, and the Aum Affair</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The 21st century has been witness to the proliferation of religious extremist groups and terrorist attacks committed by these groups. Much ink has therefore been spilled discussing the notion of religious violence, what it consists of, why it exists, and whether or not it should be understood as being particularly dangerous. In response to these inquiries, William T. Cavanaugh, a Catholic priest and theologian, has sought to deconstruct the notion of religious violence. Cavanaugh has argued that the term religious violence portrays acts of violence committed by religious groups as solely being the product of their religious beliefs, when such a thing is far from the truth, as no act of violence can take place in isolation. This thesis will prove Cavanaugh’s central argument correct through an analysis of 3 case studies that are typically understood as being significant acts of religious violence, the Jonestown massacre of 1978, the conflict at Waco between the FBI/BATF and the Branch Davidians in 1993, and the release of Sarin gas onto the Tokyo subway system in 1995 by the group Aum Shinrikyo. By analyzing these 3 case studies through Cavanaugh’s theoretical lens, this thesis will argue that the case studies in question should not be understood as incidents of religious violence, as to do so would be to ignore the fact that the violence undertaken was the product years of latent tension between secular authorities and the religious groups in question for reasons that had little to do with religious beliefs.</etd_ms:description>

Tau Lewis’ T.A.U.B.I.S. (2020)</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the paradox of what it means to live Blackness within a world founded upon its destruction through a critical art historical analysis of Jamaican-Canadian artist Tau Lewis’ exhibition Triumphant Alliance of the Ubiquitous Blossoms of Incarnate Souls (T.A.U.B.I.S.) (2020). Adopting a Black feminist framework rooted in methods of opacity, I interrogate the racist visual, cultural, and social economies that have continuously objectified and dehumanized Black people since the transatlantic slave trade. In doing so, I illuminate how Lewis’ work navigates structures of anti-Black violence and reimagines Black diasporic life beyond white supremacist patriarchal capitalist impositions of negation. Drawing from Black studies scholar Saidiya Hartman’s notion of the afterlife of slavery, I establish Lewis’ work within a larger legacy of Black diasporic practices of Black refusal, care, relation, and radical imagination that grapples towards liberatory ends. At the same time, I consider how T.A.U.B.I.S.’ interdisciplinary nature—which includes poetry, speculative fiction, and hand-sewn textile sculptures which represent imagined Black motherly ancestors—emerges as an expansive site of Black diasporic possibility that transcends reductive constructs of biological determinism. Ultimately, this thesis argues that with T.A.U.B.I.S., Lewis not only tends to present-day Black diasporic subjectivities, but further prompts vital strategies for knowing and living Blackness otherwise in the still unfolding aftermaths of slavery.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis introduces a groundbreaking step-by-step framework to translate Afro-Indigenous and other Indigenous languages anti-colonially without any racist and White Supremacist scientific biases (contrary to the established institutional norm and practice). It shows how to avoid whitewashing such translations and how to properly Indigenize the text as needed. This framework imparts tools to help properly retranslate corrupt source texts (i.e. original source texts that are so whitewashed that they erase Haitian's core Afro-Indigeneity). This thesis uses Frankétienne's seminal Masterpiece Dezafi as a model of what true Haitian looks like and of what a bias-free source and target texts need to look like post-translation to be scientifically accurate. As such, a breakdown of some of the top most common mistakes is introduced what is specific to translations from and into Haitian. Overarchingly, this thesis debunks historically entrenched racist and White Supremacist myths pervasive in Translation Studies (and beyond) about Haitian and it scientifically disproves its imposed status as a so-called "Creole" language and instead establishes it as a legitimate fully fledged Afro-Indigenous language that is anti-colonially African and Indigenous rather than reductively or necessarily "French".</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Les travaux dédiés aux activistes trans tendent à les dépourvoir de leur agentivité et attribuent leur pouvoir politique à une subversion par essence des normes de genre. Cette recherche prend le contrepied de ce postulat et défend que les personnes trans sont des actrices politiques par ce qu´elles font, et non pour ce qu´elles sont. À travers une histoire orale de l´ExisTranInter, une marche annuelle pour les droits des personnes trans et intersexes, ce mémoire analyse les formes d´activismes adoptées par les personnes trans, en France, depuis la fin des années 90. Dans un premier temps, je me penche sur l´invisibilisation des personnes trans dans l´histoire des mouvements sociaux. En analysant les silences dans les travaux en histoire sociale et en histoire des minorités sexuelles, j´argumente que l´histoire des personnes trans est rarement écrite au travers de leurs mobilisations politiques. Dans un second temps, j´établis une chronologie de l´ExisTransInter en me basant sur les phases organisationnelles de la marche. Cet angle me permet d´illustrer la variété d´opinions et de pratiques politiques qui traversent le militantisme trans français, et complexifient l´idée d´une « communauté trans » unifiée. Enfin, je me concentre sur les choix stratégiques adoptés par les activistes et leurs articulations avec les revendications des mouvements trans et intersexes. Dans ce dernier chapitre, je montre que l´étude des personnes trans à travers leurs pratiques politiques remet en cause le particularisme qu´on attribue aux enjeux trans et intersexes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Like many nations, Canada faces challenges stemming from climate change. Therefore, it aims to reduce overall emissions, measured in megatonnes of CO2 equivalents (MTCO2eq), by 40-45%, relative to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This paper introduces Environment and Climate Change Canada’s Multi-Sector, Multi-Region (EC-MSMR) recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, capable of evaluating multiple pathways to reaching emissions-based targets using market-based policies. CGE models capture direct and indirect effects in response to a policy change, making them excellent tools for evaluating economy-wide environmental policies. The EC-MSMR model delivers granular insights into Canada’s emissions and economic activity on the global stage by incorporating data from seventeen aggregated regions and twenty-three commodity-producing sectors, along with three final demand sectors: Consumption, Investment, and Government Spending. With this model, this paper analyzes Canada’s participation in a global Emissions Trading System (ETS) with perfect commitment versus a domestic carbon pricing schedule that adjusts itself to the shadow price that achieves the 2030 target. Results indicate that participating in a global ETS provides slightly greater economic growth and welfare while reducing reliance on fossil fuels to domestic carbon pricing alone. Although both policy experiments meet Canada’s 2030 target, both scenarios experience lower GDP and welfare outcomes than a baseline consisting solely of existing policies and no additional action.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Many products and services today are advertised as “authentic;” however, not all consumers are equally knowledgeable about what this means. Cultural products, including tequila, are marketed with culturally congruent cultural symbols to increase consumers' perception of authenticity. However, research suggests consumers vary in their level of cultural expertise based on either their cultural identification or cosmopolitanism, which may moderate this relationship. This paper addresses the gap in the literature by measuring participants' level of cultural knowledge by the number of cultural symbols they recognize as Mexican and examines whether a participant’s expected cultural expertise can explain how many cultural symbols participants recognize, which explains their increased accuracy in identifying authentic product labels. The results illustrate that the more cultural cues participants recognize, the better they are at correctly identifying objectively authentic product labels. Although this paper finds no grounds for cultural expertise to moderate this relationship, consumers vary in their knowledge of cultural symbols, which should be considered when marketing to multiple consumer segments. It is suggested that ethnic products be marketed to a broader consumer market ethically, and future research could explore whether interest in a particular culture can explain the increased level of cultural knowledge.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Nature-based education appears as a powerful response to the increase of an indoor and sedentary lifestyle. Nature-based education refers to a practice where nature is central to children’s daily experiences, such as routines, exploration, and play, and includes opportunities to connect and become comfortable with nature. It offers multiple benefits for children’s whole development (e.g., Kuo et al. 2019). Literature on infants’ experiences with nature is limited (e.g., Jørgensen, 2018; Monti et al., 2019). The present qualitative case study examined the experiences of infants younger than 18-months-old and their educators in two not-for-profit Québec daycares: one urban and one semi-rural centre that integrated regular nature-based practices into their curriculum. Observations examined 19 infants’ experiences into the outdoor natural setting and with their four educators. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with each educator to investigate their perspectives on this approach with infants. Results demonstrated that the natural environment offered a rich context for infants’ whole development in an integrated way: cognitive, social, language, and motor. Educators offered a secure base in a child-led pedagogy by being responsive, sharing joint attention, and supporting infants’ learning experiences verbally and physically.  They also held a strong vision of infants as active learners, which is crucial to a child-led pedagogy in a nature-based context. Still, the educators must display strong self-confidence, teamwork and organizational skills to overcome the invisibility of this age group in the guidelines, training, and information for outdoor practices. The findings have important pedagogical and policy implications for the well-being of Quebec’s youngest citizens to make them more visible and to offer them a rich context to explore and learn.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring the spatiotemporal patterns of theta-band activity during rapid-eye movement sleep: a magnetoencephalography analysis</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Provias, Vasiliki</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) are a prominent electrophysiological feature of rapid-eye move- ment (REM) sleep. Theta activity during REM sleep has been linked to memory consolidation; however, the role of cortical theta oscillations in this process remains unclear. Interestingly, theta rhythms are not exclusive to REM sleep but also appear in frontal regions during resting wakefulness and working memory tasks. To advance our understanding of human REM sleep and the mechanisms that support memory processing, a spatially resolved, whole-brain char- acterisation of REM oscillatory activity is essential. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offers high temporal and spatial resolution, making it ideal for examining the topographic distribu- tion of theta oscillations in REM sleep. In this study, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG)/MEG data during overnight sleep in 10 healthy subjects. We also analysed a separate MEG/EEG data of 17 healthy subjects who performed a working memory task. Our aims were to characterise the spatio-temporal patterns of theta-band activity during REM sleep by 1) dis- tinguishing theta from the overlapping alpha (8-12 Hz) network, 2) comparing REM and non- rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep oscillatory activity, and 3) evaluating similarities between REM and working memory task theta patterns. Our results show theta activity in frontal mid- line regions is best observed within a focused 5-7 Hz range, separating it from occipital alpha activity. Theta-band activity was greater in REM sleep compared to NREM in frontal-central, parietal, temporal, and subcortical regions. Theta topographies during the working memory task correlated positively with phasic REM sleep. These results enhance our understanding of REM sleep physiology and suggest future research targets for learning and memory roles.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring How Body Diversity Impacts the Effectiveness of Marketing Communications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Psihogios, Sarah</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Past research on body diversity has largely focused on the positive impact plus-size models in media have on consumers’ self-esteem and body image, but the impact of these diversity efforts on consumer responses to marketing communications and the advertised brands is less conclusive. This research aimed to understand why (and when) consumers may react more positively (or negatively) to body diversity and investigates the underlying psychological mechanism involved in the effect. To address this question, I employed experimental methods across one pre-test and three studies, one exploratory (Study 1) and two confirmatory (Study 2a and 2b). Participants in these studies were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and were asked to evaluate a sponsored social media post featuring either a plus-size or thin model advertising a luggage (Studies 1 and 2a) or an app (Study 2b). Along with a significant main effect of model size on attitudes and marginally significant main effects on behavioral intentions and purchase likelihood, an exploratory serial mediation effect was found through participants’ opinion of the model and their perceived persuasion intent of the post. Study 2 aimed to replicate and confirm these findings. Study 2a used the same stimuli (i.e., carry-on luggage) to closely replicate Study 1, while Study 2b conceptually replicated it using a lower-involvement product (i.e., a mobile game app). Both Study 2a and 2b replicated the serial mediation effects found in Study 1. Finally, theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Detecting Man-in-the-Middle Attacks in Cellular Networks
Using Generative Machine Learning Based Indistinguishable Probing</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Purohit, Hinddeep Shaileshbhai</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks launched against the user equipment (UE) and the core networks represent a well-known security threat to the proper operation of telecommunication networks from earlier generations. Such attacks can potentially downgrade the security capabilities or degrade the quality of service to either prepare the ground for subsequent attacks or cause denial of service to the end users. Existing solutions focus on detecting specific MiTM attacks (e.g., utilizing false base stations or malicious UEs) while relying on the Radio Access Network (RAN) and considering it as a trusted entity. With the advent of virtualization of the RAN (i.e., vRAN) and the opening of the interfaces ( i.e., Open RAN), an attacker can potentially infect the vRAN (e.g., due to lateral movement) and launch MiTM attacks, making existing solutions not sufficient to cover this new attack vector. In this thesis, we therefore aim at proposing a verification solution, named Orion, for detecting the presence of a stealthy and smart MiTM attacker between UE and the core. For this purpose, our main ideas are (a) to leverage generative ML to continuously generate indistinguishable (to evade an MiTM attacker) and synchronous (to enable verification at both UE and core with minimal communication overhead) probing messages and (b) to engage both UE and the core in the verification (unlike existing works that only focus on one of them) of the probing messages to detect MiTM attacks. We implement Orion and integrate it into our testbed based on the OpenAirInterface (a popular open-source project used to test 4G and 5G), deployed on a Kubernetes cluster on the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. To show case the feasibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of Orion, we use a MiTM attack scenario targeting specific unprotected control plane messages carrying radio and security capabilities. Our experiments show that Orion can detect such MiTM attacks using 14 probing (virtual) UEs in only 40 seconds (during which only two regular messages are compromised) and requiring about 60 probes on average while achieving an indistinguishability rate of 95% under different adversarial strategies. Additionally, Orion requires less than 350MB of memory, up to 100% of CPU for a little less than 17 minutes of time to generate probing messages required for each day of probing.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>L’amnésie collective causée par la purge des arts et des passeurs de savoirs durant le génocide des Khmers rouges a engendré un mémoricide, marqué par la perte des archives et la rupture de la transmission orale, privant les Cambodgiens des repères pour négocier l’évolution de leur identité collective. Cette fragmentation, amplifiée par la diasporisation massive dès 1979, a conduit à l’aplanissement et à la distorsion des histoires, à la perte de la langue khmère et à l’ancrage d’un silence latent, amplifiant les effets du fossé et trauma intergénérationnels. Pris entre la mélancolie et la dissociation raciale, une majorité de Cambodgiens au Québec peine à s’approprier sa culture et à participer au mouvement de renaissance khmère en effervescence depuis plus de quinze ans au Cambodge, en France et aux États-Unis. Cette recherche-création est une expérimentation méthodologique sur l’apport de l’illustration comme langage visuel pour réactiver les mémoires et les savoirs, afin de produire de nouvelles histoires orales : quel récit mettre en l’avant, comment le représenter et le raconter? Grâce à une revue de littérature et de médias, des interviews d’aînés cambodgiens, des archives retrouvées, puis une analyse d’artéfacts culturels et des tactiques de réappropriation narrative en illustration, ce projet aboutit à un court récit visuel muet sur l’histoire non-documentée de l’écriture khmère au Québec. La thèse conclut en mobilisant les thèmes de la mémoire, de l’espoir et du langage visuel de l’illustration pour répondre à l’interrogation implicite qui traverse ce projet : comment exister face à l’effacement?</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Qiu, Zirui</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis delves into the realm of interpretability in medical image processing, focusing on deep learning's role in enhancing the transparency and understandability of automated diagnostics in chest X-ray analysis. As deep learning models become increasingly integral to medical diagnostics, the imperative for these models to be interpretable has never been more pronounced. This work is anchored in two main studies that address the challenge of interpretability from distinct yet complementary perspectives. The first study scrutinizes the effectiveness of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) across various deep learning architectures, specifically evaluating its reliability in the context of pneumothorax diagnosis in chest X-ray images. Through a systematic analysis, this research reveals how different neural network architectures and depths influence the robustness and clarity of Grad-CAM visual explanations, providing valuable insights for selecting and designing interpretable deep learning models in medical imaging. Building on the foundational understanding of interpretability, the second study introduces a novel deep learning framework that enhances the synergy between disease diagnosis and the prediction of visual saliency maps in chest X-rays. This dual-encoder, multi-task UNet architecture, augmented by a multi-stage cooperative learning strategy, offers a sophisticated approach to interpretability. By aligning the model's attention with that of clinicians, the framework not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also provides intuitive visual explanations that resonate with clinical expertise. Together, these studies contribute to the field of medical image processing by offering innovative approaches to improve the interpretability of deep learning models. The findings underscore the potential of interpretability-enhanced models to foster trust among medical practitioners, facilitate better clinical decision-making, and pave the way for the broader acceptance and integration of AI in healthcare diagnostics. The thesis concludes by synthesizing the insights gained from both projects and outlining prospective pathways for future research to further advance the interpretability and utility of AI in medical imaging.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The circadian rhythm, regulated by clock genes, plays a pivotal role in regulating physiological and behavioral processes, including mood regulation and alcohol consumption. Despite significant advancements in understanding the interplay between circadian dysregulation and affective disorders, the specific role of Bmal1 within the prefrontal cortex on modulating mood-like behaviors and alcohol binge drinking is not fully understood. This research aims to address this gap by investigating the effects of selectively deleting Bmal1 in the prefrontal cortex on these behavioral outcomes in male and female mice. Female Bmal1 knockout mice exhibited reduced depressive-like behaviors and heightened anxiety-like behaviors. This contrasted with male counterparts where no significant alterations in mood-related behaviors were observed. This study provides new perspectives into the role of Bmal1 in the prefrontal cortex in affective behavior and alcohol binge drinking male and female mice, emphasizes the importance of considering sex-specific responses.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>To improve energy efficiency in concrete buildings and reduce CO2 emissions, this thesis explores the integration of microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) into cementitious materials. This approach can negatively affect the properties of the mixtures, so a multi-response TOPSIS-based Taguchi optimization was used to address these issues.
The first study focused on optimizing mixtures with MPCMs by considering workability, compressive strength, and tensile strength. Key factors included cement content (400, 450, 500 kg/m³), water-to-cement ratio (0.45, 0.50, 0.55), and MPCMs content (5%, 10%, 20% volume replacement of sand). The water-to-cement ratio was found to be crucial for workability, while MPCMs content significantly influenced strength, particularly above 10%. Suitable mixtures with adequate thermal properties were identified, and multivariable regression models were developed for performance prediction.
The second study examined the role of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM), specifically fly ash (FA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber, in enhancing mixtures with MPCMs. PVA fiber notably affected workability and compressive strength, especially above 0.5%. Fly ash improved workability and compensated for later-age strength loss, with regression models predicting mixture performance.
The third study explored MPCMs in ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) to enhance thermal storage and reduce energy use. Despite initial negative impacts, the inclusion of micro steel fibers improved both thermal properties and impact energy absorption, increasing the ductility of MPCM-UHPC samples.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The integration of extended reality (XR) technologies such as augmented reality (AR), and artificial intelligence (AI), is transforming virtual shopping and virtual relationships, but also raising significant privacy concerns. We therefore develop two frameworks to examine privacy issues in both virtual shopping and virtual AI companion platforms, emphasizing the need for enhanced transparency and user protection. For virtual shopping, our analysis of 138 virtual try-on (VTO) websites and 28 Android apps reveals that 65% of websites and 18% of apps transmit user images to servers, often involving third-party servers. Additionally, 43 websites and 2 apps store user images, and 37% of websites use providers that extract facial geometry. Privacy policy violations were found in 17% of websites which collect user images. Significant security vulnerabilities were also identified in one VTO provider, putting both merchants and users at risk. In parallel, the study of 21 Android AI companion chatbot apps reveals discrepancies between privacy policies and chatbot responses to questions about privacy practices. All apps showed inadequate age verification and extensive tracking practices. Specifically, 13 apps used at least three tracking services, and 18 apps sent detailed device information to these services. None of the apps implemented measures to prevent users from falsifying birthdates, continuing conversations with underage users. This thesis highlights critical privacy and security issues in two growing domains in the virtual world (virtual shopping and AI companions), calling for improved transparency, better privacy practices, and stronger user protection measures.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Deluxe or de-luxe? Exploring the effects of price discounting and brand messaging on luxury perceptions for new brands</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Raheja, Varun Mahesh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>For many products, brand managers use price promotions to address challenges such as diminishing growth or excess inventory. Luxury brands face the same challenges, but unlike other brands, they may face constraints in using price promotions given that luxury brands are generally associated with high price points. In particular, managers of new luxury brands may wish to use promotions as a means to acquire new customers; however, they are often concerned that reducing prices may affect consumers’ brand luxury perceptions. Is it possible for luxury brands to maintain luxury perceptions when discounting their products? While past research has shed light on the pros and cons of price promotions, little research has explored how different discount levels (low vs. high) may affect brand luxury perceptions and, more importantly, how brand messaging might buffer luxury brands against potential negative impacts of discounts. I hypothesize that brand messaging—i.e., an agentic (independent) vs. communal (interdependent) positioning—may affect consumers’ luxury perceptions at low and high discount levels, and that perceived strategic fit may drive effects. Across three experiments, participants were presented with display ads in which brand messaging and discount level were varied. While Study 1 yielded null effects, Study 2 revealed a marginally significant discount level x brand messaging interaction on luxury perceptions. Perceptions of strategic fit mediated these results. Finally, Study 3 attempted to replicate study 2 findings and explore the downstream effects of luxury perceptions on purchase intentions. In this study, luxury perceptions were primarily affected by discount level, while purchase intentions were primarily affected by brand messaging. My thesis discusses theoretical contributions, avenues for future research, and managerial implications related to price discounting for luxury brands.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>A new dual-band electromagnetic band gap (DBEBG) periodic printed structure is presented here. Designing the periodic unit cell within the periodic boundaries is sufficient to determine the EBG or DBEBG. The concept of the dual-band unit cell is based on stacking two different periodic textures with different parameters. The upper band texture considers the top of the lower band surface texture as a deformed back. Thus, a form of interaction between them makes designing each band individually challenging. Therefore, a comprehensive parametric study is required to design a DBEBG that controls the stop bands. A unit cell with a period of 1.8 mm is presented, achieving a 13-24 GHz and 34-44 GHz DBEBG with the proper parameters. 
The effect of inserting the printed ridge breaking the periodicity creates propagating modes within the EBG bands, guiding the electromagnetic waves between the upper conductor and the ridge and suppressing them elsewhere, named PRGW provides dual-band, 13-24 and 34-44 GHz. A dual-band ridge with two 90-degree bends is demonstrated with simulated results of 13-22 and 32-42 GHz. Bends affect guide's scattering parameters, influencing signal reflection and transmission. Discontinuities are common in microwave systems, necessitating investigation during design them. The dual-band power divider is designed within the DBEBG structure, providing 16-24 and 32.5-42.5 GHz. Two quadrature hybrid couplers within a DBEBG support a lower band 14-26 GHz, 60% fractional bandwidth at 20 GHz and an upper band 33-41 GHz, 21.6% fractional bandwidth at 37 GHz. They maintain a 90° ±10° phase difference between coupled and through ports, with isolation levels below 10 dB. The dual-band design holds potential for millimeter-wave applications and dual-band filter design.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Development of a Condition Assessment Rating System and Prediction Model for Railway Tracks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rajendran, Bharath Rajendir</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Canada has an extensive rail network spanning 45,000 kilometres. The railway system plays a 
crucial role in serving almost every sector of the Canadian economy. Primarily, it transports freight 
to and from the U.S. and global markets through coastal ports. However, failures in the railway 
infrastructure can have severe safety and financial consequences. In 2023, 43.13% of main-track 
derailments were attributed to track defects, according to the Transportation Safety Board of 
Canada. These defects, including issues with track geometry and component failures, underline 
the need for better track condition monitoring and maintenance to prevent derailments. This 
research aims to address this need by developing a comprehensive rating system for evaluating the 
condition of ties and rail fastening components and machine learning models to predict future track 
conditions. While traditional condition assessment ratings have relied on subjective evaluations 
and considered components separately, this study proposes a Tie and Rail Fastening system that 
evaluates the condition of ties, tie plates, and spikes. Domain expertise was incorporated through 
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritize the importance of various defects. The resulting 
weighting system provides a more detailed and integrated approach compared to existing rating 
methods, which primarily focus on crack size. Machine learning models, including Random 
Forest, XGBoost, and Cat Boost, were employed to predict future conditions, such as defect tags, 
amplitude, and length. These models achieved a 95% accuracy for detecting defect tags and a 75% 
accuracy when predicting defect tags based on predicted amplitude. On the one hand, the proposed 
tie and rail fastening rating system can improve the prioritization of future rail maintenance works. 
On the other hand, the proposed machine learning models can improve the planning of future 
maintenance by offering better tools for monitoring and predicting track conditions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Inter-vehicle Collision Avoidance Strategies For Input-constrained Differential-drive Robots Moving In Shared Environments</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rajkumar, Suryaprakash</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis presents two different collision avoidance and control strategies for coordinated and uncoordinated multi-agent robotic systems. In the considered setup, each agent is a differential-drive robot subject to input constraints on the wheels angular velocities. For the coordinated control problem, we propose a collision-free platooning solution utilizing a leader-follower approach. The leader robot follows a predefined reference trajectory, while the follower robots track the leader's pose with an inter-agent delay that is properly designed to avoid inter-vehicle collision. In particular, by resorting to feedback linearization tools, the kinematic models of both leader and followers are linearized, allowing a formal characterization of the platoon's error dynamics and input constraints. To address the platooning trajectory tracking control problem, we employ a set-theoretic model predictive control strategy which is complemented by an ad-hoc collision avoidance policy ensuring collision-free movement among agents. On the other hand, to address uncoordinated situations where the vehicles move in a shared environment, we propose a novel collision prevention mechanism which is inspired by traditional traffic light mechanisms.  The developed framework leverages a set-theoretic model predictive waypoint tracking strategy with feedback linearization, enabling each robot to follow a sequence of waypoints. Moreover, a centralized traffic manager identifies potential collisions using reachability arguments and models potential collisions through a connectivity graph. The collision resolution policy aims to minimize the number of agents required to stop at any given time. Furthermore,  taking advantage of a possible finite preview of future waypoints, the traffic manager can also instruct (adjust) the maximum velocity allowed for each vehicle in order to reduce the likelihood of future collisions. Finally, all the strategies presented in this thesis have been validated via hardware-in-loop experiments using three Khepera-IV differential drive robots.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Hybrid Neuroevolutionary Approach to the Design of Convolutional Neural Networks for 2D and 3D Medical Image Segmentation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ramesh, Nivedha</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis highlights the development and evaluation of a hybrid neuroevolutionary approach for designing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and segmentation tasks. We integrate Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) with Novelty Search and Simulated Annealing algorithms to optimize the CNN architectures efficiently.

The challenge lies in reducing the computational demands and inefficiencies of traditional Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques. To address this, a flexible framework based on CGP is utilized for evolving network architectures. Novelty Search facilitates the exploration of varied architectural landscapes, promoting diversity of solutions. Simulated
Annealing further refines these solutions, optimizing the balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting known good solutions within the search space.

Our experiments, conducted on benchmark datasets such as DRIVE and MSD, demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in generating competitive segmentation models. On the DRIVE dataset, our models achieved Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 0.828 and 0.814, and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.716 and 0.736, respectively. For the MSD dataset, our models exhibited DSC scores up to 0.924 for the Heart task, showcasing the potential of our method in handling complex segmentation challenges across different medical imaging modalities.

The significance of this research lies in its hybrid approach that efficiently navigates the search space for CNN architectures, thus reducing number of fitness evaluations while achieving near state of art performance. Future work will explore enhancing the algorithm’s effectiveness through advanced data preprocessing techniques, and the exploration of more complex network layers. Our findings highlight the potential of evolutionary algorithms and local search in advancing automated CNN design for medical image segmentation, offering a promising direction for future research in the field.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Optimization of airfoils and wing planforms for airborne wind
energy applications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rangriz, Sina</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research work focuses on the optimization of airfoils and wings for the use in airborne wind energy applications, especially crosswind kite power systems. The thesis is divided into three major parts. Each part includes an optimization framework which is composed of four blocks: an airfoil or wing geometry builder, an aerodynamic solver, an optimizer, and a post-processor. These blocks interact with each other to solve the problem of maximizing/minimizing an aerodynamic objective function while at the same time maximizing/minimizing a structural objective function such as airfoil thickness or wing aspect ratio. It is thus inevitable to have a multi-objective framework that includes both objective functions. 

The first part addresses airfoil optimization by minimizing the inverse aerodynamic efficiency and the negative maximum thickness ratio, which are conflicting objectives. Results with and without induced drag (from a finite aspect ratio wing) and tether drag effects show that optimal airfoils accounting for induced drag have a cusped trailing edge, while those considering tether drag have a flap-like trailing edge, both improving aerodynamic performance.

The second part focuses on wing planform optimization, aiming to minimize the inverse aerodynamic efficiency and aspect ratio simultaneously. The optimization framework is validated by minimizing the drag-to-lift ratio, resulting in wings with elliptic planforms. The planforms optimized for aerodynamic efficiency do not differ significantly from elliptic shapes.


The third part of the thesis deals with the optimization of box-wing airfoils. Box-wings consist of two wings connected by vertical fins at their tips, forming a box-like shape when viewed from the front. The analysis is performed for an infinite aspect ratio, i.e., two-dimensional configuration. The inverse of the total aerodynamic efficiency and the negative of the combined maximum thickness ratio of the two airfoils are minimized simultaneously. The numerical results indicate that the optimal configurations feature a thick lower (or forward) airfoil and a thin upper (or aft) airfoil. This suggests that the lower airfoil primarily serves a structural role, while the upper airfoil plays a crucial aerodynamic role.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Raposo, Alyssa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The transition from preschool to kindergarten is a very exciting time in a child’s life (Rimm-Kaufman &amp; Pianta, 1999). This transition introduces the students to new changes in their environment, where they are exposed to new teachers, classmates, and responsibilities (Yamuchi, 2020). These new changes can affect children behaviourally, socially, and emotionally since preschool and kindergarten have very different dynamics. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to have more difficulty transitioning to kindergarten compared to neurotypical children, causing them to be more vulnerable during this change (Fontil &amp; Petrakos, 2015). This study explored the experiences of ten (10) parents with children with ASD during their children’s transition to kindergarten from preschool. A semi-structured interview was used to understand their perspectives and the experiences of their child’s transition to kindergarten. These questions explored their thoughts and feelings about their child’s transitions, challenges, and successes. The findings found that participants had a lot of support from their child’s daycare, but as they went to kindergarten, the amount of support decreased significantly. Participants who experienced successful transitions were due to the collaboration between parents, daycare, and school personnel, as well as intensive support and understanding of the child’s needs. Several challenges included unsupportive teachers, a lack of resources from elementary schools, and unrepresentative IEPs. This study underscores the importance of collaboration among kindergarten teachers, parents, and daycare educators to facilitate the successful transition of children with ASD and assist children in preparation for kindergarten.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This research addresses the critical challenge of path planning for autonomous vehicles by integrating Social Value Orientation (SVO) into path-planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. The framework utilizes a fuzzy logic-based system to evaluate and categorize the social values of pedestrians and vehicles in real time by considering their observed behaviors and social cues. This approach enables autonomous vehicles to make more informed and socially aware decisions, thereby enhancing their ability to interact safely with human road users. In addition, the thesis introduces an adaptive artificial potential field (APF) method that dynamically assesses the dangers presented by different road users, taking into account factors such as type, size, speed, and societal importance. By integrating road layout and traffic signal potential fields, the APF method guarantees that the autonomous vehicle can navigate intricate road conditions while prioritizing safety. The effectiveness of the proposed path planning framework is rigorously validated using CARLA driving simulator. These simulations create a realistic and dynamic traffic environment, allowing for the thorough testing of custom behavioral profiles for various actors in different traffic situations. Results demonstrate the framework's practical applicability and effectiveness in enhancing the interaction between autonomous vehicles and human road users.
The outcomes of this research contribute to the development of safe and human-centric path-planning algorithms for highly automated vehicles, particularly in dense or mixed-traffic environments. This work represents a significant step towards creating autonomous systems that can coexist harmoniously with human drivers and pedestrians, ultimately leading to safer and more efficient roadways.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Over the years, the military police have been a significant perpetrator of violence in Brazil, targeting mainly Afro-Brazilians in favelas and poor suburbs. This thesis investigates the case of the military police of Rio de Janeiro to understand how, over time, public security institutions have framed discourses about the use of lethal force in Black and low-income territories. It applies the framework of discursive institutionalism, the methodology of discourse analysis and a comparative approach to analyze emblematic episodes of lethal police violence that occurred across four political eras. The results suggest that over time discourses have operated more to sustain than to change the way public security institutions deal with police killings. This was expressed by: a) arguing that the contexts of intervention compelled the police to use lethal force; b) asserting that the institution was not directly responsible for the killings; c) explicitly defending the public security model in force or the police approach in the episodes analyzed; d) claiming that there was a political interest behind the repercussions of these episodes. When public security institutions, in addition to perpetuating hyper-violent approaches, fail to offer the public a more critical discursive framing of this problem, they further contribute to the trivialization of Afro-Brazilian deaths in low-income territories. This work demonstrates pathways for understanding how policy institutions create argumentative and ideological mechanisms to justify policy choices. It highlights the significance of discursive institutionalism in comprehending the role of discourse not only in processes of policy change but also in situations of policy maintenance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Quantum Magneto-Straintronics Transport in Graphene:
A Realistic Model</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Reis de Lima, Lorena</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The main objective of this research project is to develop an applied theoretical model to describe
the quantum transport of a suspended monolayer graphene transistor under the presence of
a magnetic field and unaxial strain. In the literature, we find several theoretical models for studying
monolayer and multilayer graphene under several conditions and considering different physical
properties such as spin. Although those proposed models predict interesting physical phenomena,
such as magnetic confinement of particles, they are unrealistic and often incomplete in terms of experimental
design. Here, we present a sophisticated model using a more applied approach, enabling
future realistic experiments and the extraction of important experimental data regarding physical
phenomena such as quantum magneto transport in strained graphene junctions, bridging theory and
experiment. In order to do so, we develop a set of mathematica codes to calculate conductivity for
monolayer graphene, considering both magnetic field – which contributes to the Hamiltonian as a
vector potential- and the uniaxial mechanical strain ( x direction) – which contributes with strain
induced potentials. Two main new device geometries are introduced in this thesis: a transistor with
a magnetic field applied to its channel and another with both magnetic field and unaxial mechanical
strain. We report that those devices are candidates for quantum electronic components, which
should be of much interest for applications. They have a high on-off ratio and their conductivity is
easily suppressed by the presence of a magnetic field and mechanical strain.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis puts formal analysis of films by Kamal Aljafari and Larissa Sansour in dialogue with scholarship on both contemporary Palestinian issues and their cinematic representations. Through this analysis I highlight the visuality of the ecological and architectural violence sustained by Palestinians and the resistance to these structures of oppression realized by Aljafari’s and Sansour’s images. Their films showcase a Palestinian perspective on spatial issues in their engagement with built and natural environments through film form, demonstrating how cinema can foster reimagined futures. Palestinian cinema provides a mode of resistance to Zionist spatial logic and to the occupation. To clarify this, I explore how Israel’s settler colonial project uses infrastructure and ecology as tools to maintain control of Palestinian land through my analysis of a promotional video by Zionist tree-planting organization HaYovel. Palestinian cinema resists this and this thesis argues that many Palestinian filmmakers, including Aljafari and Sansour, reclaim Palestinian space using the medium of cinema and cinematic techniques. Because of the lack of physical access to Palestine for diasporic Palestinians, inhabiting space digitally and imagining new spatial configurations through cinematic techniques allow these filmmakers to experience a different kind of presence on the land. I analyze several recent short films by Aljafari and Sansour to demonstrate how editing, mise-en-scène, and dialogue allow for filmmakers to transgress imposed spatial boundaries and return to Palestine, if only digitally.</etd_ms:description>

Determinants of M&amp;A and Defensive Use of Buybacks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rejili, Haifa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>There is an extensive literature on the determinants of the likelihood of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), however, there is limited research on how a crisis impacts the likelihood of M&amp;A. We examine a sample of 20,076 events to investigate the direction of influence of two 
distinct crises (the financial crisis and Covid-19) on the likelihood of M&amp;A. In addition, we assess the impact of M&amp;A likelihood on the probability of buyback announcements as buybacks can be used as a defensive strategy against M&amp;A attempts. We find smaller firms with higher liquidity and leverage are more likely to be targeted post-crisis. Additionally, we note that while bidders were more inclined towards more profitable firms following the financial crisis, less profitable firms were more appealing acquisition candidates after the Covid-19 crisis. Tobin’s Q was not statistically significant during post-crisis periods. We find that the probability of announcing a buyback is positively related to the likelihood of being a target in the pre-crisis periods, however, this relationship disappears post-crisis. It appears that firms reassess their use of share repurchases to deter acquirers in the event of a crisis. Our robustness tests highlight the importance of studying the impact of each crisis independently and show that our findings are not driven by random variation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis proposes a novel nonlinear estimator to estimate the state of a class of systems with linear dynamics and noisy quadratic measurements. It is shown that the error dynamics is described by a nonlinear Verhulst logistic equation. This observation unveils a link between population dynamics and state estimation for this class of systems. The stationary distribution of the estimation error converges to a zero-mean Gaussian with adjustable variance.
This estimator is used to estimate the physical state variables in energy harvesters by using the measurement of electrical energy. Furthermore, the problem of estimating the position of a quadrotor in waypoint navigation using noisy range measurements can be formulated in a way in which it can be solved by the proposed estimator. This application emphasizes the practical use of the estimator, which guides the quadrotor through various pipeline configurations. The quadrotor’s input is designed to maintain the piecewise affine trajectory within the thickness of the pipeline for the inspection task. The simulation results illustrate a stable estimation error that consistently converges to an area around zero with different initial conditions. In addition to evaluating the performance of the proposed estimator, a comparison is made with the Kalman filter for the augmented linearized system.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>At the margins of the industrial economy of the mid-twentieth century, economic change in the American commercial fishing industry challenged its very market, social, and environmental relations. The issue of overfishing became a national one in the 1960s and by 1976, the U.S. Congress passed the Magnuson-Stevens Act, nationalizing waters within 200 miles of its coast. And yet, it wasn’t until the 1990s, with the collapse of fisheries across the Northwest Atlantic, that the notion of the unchangeable ocean would lose its hold over politics. This project considers the industrial decline in fisheries through the lens of neoliberalism and deindustrialization, an approach rarely used in fisheries history. Using the archive of the Point Judith Fishermen’s Cooperative Association (1947-1996), Rhode Island, USA, this thesis considers the history of industrial decline from the experiences of fishermen themselves. Instead of fishermen’s jobs going overseas, Point Judith fishermen experienced consolidation and atomization, relying on the free market to access economic security while experiencing the squeeze of global free trade. Industrial decline in fisheries highlights the contradictions within late 20th century America, in which economic nationalism and neoliberalism went hand-in-hand. Not only did neoliberalism impact how the fishing industry was governed and financed, but it shaped how fishermen were treated as workers. This thesis strikes a path to excavate the history of fishermen’s class consciousness at the nexus of ecological and economic pressures in an era of industrial decline.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring Natural Product Biosynthesis in Photorhabdus laumondii: A Novel Strategy through Activation of  Bacterial Enhancer Binding Proteins.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rili, Lydia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Natural products (NPs), Photorhabdus laumondii TTO1, bacteria, bacterial enhancer binding proteins (bEBPs), DctD, σ54, biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>It has been reported that the number of known natural products is much less than the number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) found in the genomes of microorganisms, which suggests a considerable potential for new drug discovery. However,  a significant challenge arises as these BGCs cannot be induced in a laboratory setting. Due to high fitness cost for bacteria, these encoded natural products are tightly regulated. Consequently, our limited understanding of the triggers and regulatory mechanisms of these BGCs impedes progress in the search for potential antibiotics. 

To tackle this issue, we propose an alternative approach distinct from the traditional methods such as high-throughput screening, heterologous expression, or the introduction of constitutive promoters. Our strategy involves using the bacterial machinery to activate the expression of BGCs by constitutively activating their bacterial enhancer binding proteins (bEBPs). This is achieved by deleting the regulatory domain located at the N-terminal of bEBPs. The majority of these bEBPs are responsible for activating the σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme, thereby initiating transcription.  

We have demonstrated σ54’s importance in regulating the expression of a wide range of natural products in Photorhabdus laumondii. This was achieved by utilizing the core domain of DctD (DctD(141-394)), a bEBP from Sinorhizobium meliloti. Further examination of the modified P. laumondi bEBP (mEBPs) revealed diverse effects on natural product expression involving activation and/or repression. Some of these mEBPs exhibit elevated expression levels and, in certain instances, demonstrate propensity for specific natural products compared to DctD(141-394). These preliminary findings suggest that mEBPs, could in time enable us to selectively express a subset of σ54-dependent BGCs. This would bypass the need for specific growth conditions, unlocking a reservoir of previously inaccessible natural products.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Measuring the Immunomodulatory Effects of beta-Adrenergic Receptor Drugs on THP-1-Derived M1 and M2 Macrophage-Like Cells.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rios, Amanda</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Macrophages play a crucial role in coordinating the immune response and regulating inflammatory balance. They exist as two main phenotypes: M1 macrophages, which are pro-inflammatory and secrete cytokines like TNF to amplify the immune response, and M2, which are anti-inflammatory and promote tissue healing by secreting cytokines like IL-10. The balance between these phenotypes is essential for effective infection control, and disruptions can lead to autoimmune diseases, severe infections, and other inflammatory disorders. Understanding the modulation of these phenotypes is key for developing effective therapies.
This project investigates the interactions between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the immune system by treating a monocyte-like cell line with β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonist and antagonist drugs. While previous studies showed that β2-AR drugs have anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages (Kast, 2000; Szelenyi et al., 2000), research on their effects on M1/M2 macrophage phenotypes and receptor selectivity is limited. This project aims to address these gaps to better understand the interplay between the SNS and immune system.
β1- and β2-AR expression was confirmed in both macrophage phenotypes, with ADRB1 and ADRB2 genes upregulated in M1-like cells (with IFNγ) and downregulated in M2-like cells. Isoproterenol, a non-selective β-AR agonist, decreased TNF in M1-like cells and increased IL-10 in M2-like cells. These effects were reversed by the non-selective β-AR antagonist bupranolol but not by the β2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. Terbutaline, a β2-selective agonist, showed similar trends and was reversed by both antagonists. This research demonstrates that SNS activity influences immune responses, promoting an anti-inflammatory profile through β-AR activation. These findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies using β-AR drugs for inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Online multiplayer games are notable breeding grounds for toxic behaviour that disproportionately affects marginalized players. For LGBTQ+ players, this is due in part with videogame’s problematic history of queer representations which relied on harmful tropes and stereotypes.  Although there have been many efforts for more inclusion and representation in these games, deep rooted hegemonic play structures persist and often players resort to transgressive styles of play to create a sense of community and identity. Despite the toxicity of these spaces, many online multiplayer games have very vibrant and diverse queer player communities, especially the asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight (2016).  This thesis uses two combined methods of analysis Dead by Daylight (2016) and its surrounding fan-content on TikTok to explore how LGBTQIA2S+ players challenge hegemonic games cultures in online multiplayer games through transgressive queer play. This thesis will first use a media-specific analysis of the game text to explore the queer play potentials of Dead by Daylight. This will inform a discourse analysis of LGBTQ+ fan content on the short form video platform TikTok to explore the documented queer play strategies of players. This project forwards the concept “the queer metagame” to describe the linkages and impact of player paratext and game text, recognizing how queer transgressive play can manifest in online multiplayer games.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>As educators it is part of our job to ensure the long-term best interest of our students.  At this point in our history, it is common knowledge that the number one threat to the futures of students is climate change.  It is therefore imperative to adjust our teaching methods accordingly by engaging in more sustainable, accessible, cross-disciplinary practices to address this concern.
It is also common knowledge that, for several hundred years now, the fields of the arts and the sciences have been considered as separate from each other; this despite the fact that the two fields were once indistinguishable. Isaac Asimov writes that, by the 1800s, the exponential nature of scientific discovery made it impossible for one person to master all the sciences and that, “… with each generation of scientists, specialization has grown more and more intense” (Asimov, 1985, p.138).  This, he goes on to say, renders scientists as “magicians – feared rather than admired” in the eyes of those who have studied other topics (Asimov, 1985, p. 138).  He also writes that one of the most integral components of scientific advancement is the ability for scientists to better communicate: this is a double-edged sword in the age of Facebook. The specialization/mystification of science combined with an abundance of social media has left us with an issue: those who do not choose to study the sciences specifically are taught very little science. The result of this has become an internet hailstorm of false information amongst a well-meaning public that simply struggles to tell good science from bad.  Mercifully, the solution is simply to make scientific concepts more palatable for those who may not possess a particularly scientific mind. After all, an individual may easily understand scientific concepts without actually being a scientist by profession.  Isaac Asimov words the same notion slightly differently, stating that a person does not necessarily need to be able to write a symphony to enjoy hearing one (Asimov, 1985).  Either way, the sentiment is the same.
Over the past year and a half, I plunged into a studio thesis process which addressed the question: how can I bring both scientific precision and sustainability into my visual arts practice and how might this inform art education practices? I researched ways we can bring scientific precision into more visual arts projects.  To do this I began by using Steiner and Kolb’s philosophies, along with the scientific method, and embarked upon a research-creation thesis that explored the above-mentioned questions. The result of my research has been this paper, and a documentary of the same name.</etd_ms:description>

This thesis explores the historical significance and contemporary dynamics of Educação de Jovens e Adultos (EJA) [Youth and Adult Education] in Brazil. I aim to comprehensively understand the socio-political contexts that have shaped EJA by tracing its evolution from the colonial era to today. Then, I investigate the literacy dynamics within EJA settings and explore Paulo Freire's pedagogical method to see if it can enhance literacy inside EJA. Using the relevant literature and legal Brazilian documents, drawing on personal experiences and insights gained from an internship in a public school in Brazil, and the narrative of my mother's journey through EJA literacy, I offer valuable perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in adult education. Through this research, I aim to underscore the importance of EJA in promoting social justice, empowerment, and inclusive growth in Brazil while highlighting the enduring legacy of Paulo Freire's pedagogical philosophy in shaping educational practices and policies in the country.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Pro-Choice is Pro-Life: Framing Abortion Social Movements in Brazil</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rodrigues Seidl, Luisa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Latin America grapples with stark inequality and stringent abortion policies, with only five out of thirty-three countries permitting elective abortions. Brazil faces challenges due to its conservative climate and stark economic inequalities, hindering the pro-choice movement since the 1970s. Despite historic activism and a brief window for legal reform in 2012 and 2018, progress remains elusive. Criminalizing abortion in Brazil has not deterred people from seeking to terminate their pregnancy, but rather jeopardizes their lives. Brazil's reproductive healthcare reveals systemic issues: a misogynistic approach, limited contraceptive choices, and commercialized childbirth. Maternal mortality, particularly affecting marginalized groups, persists, challenging the notion that anti-abortion legislation protects women and gender minorities. This research aims to explore the apparent stagnation of the pro-choice movement in Brazil. Focusing on political opportunity structure theory, the study seeks to understand the strengths and constraints within the movement. Why hasn't the pro-choice movement succeeded in legalizing elective abortions, and how can it improve? The research delves into civil society networks, feminist activists' strategies, and potential collaborations among activists and organizations. It will critically assess the impact of Brazil's healthcare system inequalities on reproductive rights, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the challenges faced by the pro-choice movement is crucial in the current context, as neighboring countries (Argentina and Colombia) recently legalized abortion following the pro-choice social movement dubbed “The Green Wave” (La Marea Verde). Furthermore, Brazil experienced a shift in political leadership and is facing mounting pressure from health practitioners, thus requiring a closer examination of pro-choice mobilizations. The study aims to contribute valuable insights that may inform strategies not only for Brazil but also for pro-choice movements globally, where the fight for reproductive rights remains a persistent and urgent issue.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Roman Justo, Karla Karina</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>kipu, quipu, kipuskamayocs, quipucamayocs, South American contemporary art, ch'ixi, yanak uywaña, decolonial, Jorge Eielson, Cecilia Vicuña, Paola Torres Nuñez del Prado</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis analyzes the presence of the Andean kipu in the work of Contemporary South American Art to discuss its potential as a decolonial tool within art spaces. With a focus on the artistic kipus of Jorge Eduardo Eielson, Cecilia Vicuña, and Paola Torres Núñez del Prado, I identify aspects of their practices that reflect Andean epistemology and ontology. By choosing this Andean textile as a source of artistic inquiry and inspiration, these artists go beyond the kipu’s aesthetic properties, employing it to explore and question historical narratives, social issues, identity, and ancestry. Their professional practices show the continued presence of the kipu as a form of art in the museum and beyond.

In order to understand the kipu’s materiality in relation to the Aymara notion of uywaña (mutual nurturing) as explained by Elvira Espejo Ayca, I begin with a historical overview of the kipu’s usage and evolution. The next section analyzes Eielson’s kipu artwork as a relevant precedent for artistic kipus. The following sections explore the works of Vicuña and Torres respectively, in connection with notions of the Andean weaver, decolonial praxis, and Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui’s proposal of a ch’ixi (mottled) identity. Finally, by considering the distinctive approaches of these artists as contemporary kipuskamayocs (kipu experts), and the notion of yanak uywaña (mutual nurturing of the arts), this thesis explores where and how the kipu can introduce aspects of the Andean knowledge into the art gallery and how it can function as a potential decolonial tool in these spaces.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Roozi, Fateme</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Urban open spaces play a pivotal role in the vitality of a city. It is imperative that these areas are designed to accommodate all members of the community. Among the groups deserving special consideration in urban planning are the elderly, individuals in wheelchairs, and parents with strollers, as they often encounter challenges related to mobility that hinder their access to public spaces.
This study endeavors to enhance the urban experience for individuals with mobility issues in Montreal's open spaces, thereby fostering greater inclusivity. The research aims to pinpoint areas of concern and overlooked aspects within these spaces, with the overarching objective of enhancing comfort and accessibility for individuals with diverse needs.
Through the development of prototypes and informative diagrams, this research seeks to illustrate practical solutions for mitigating barriers encountered by our target demographic in real-world scenarios. By observing public behavior in Montreal's urban spaces, we aim to provide actionable insights for urban designers, architects, and policymakers.
Ultimately, this research is poised to make significant contributions to the creation of more inclusive and accessible public spaces, catering to the needs of an aging population and promoting the well-being of all citizens.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Situating Kerygma in the Spiritual Schemata of Northrop Frye</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Roseman, Karol</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>kerygma, William Blake, Northrop Frye, analogia visionis</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Northrop Frye’s exploration of kerygma, traditionally considered to be the Christian proclamation leading to salvation, is the linchpin of his study of biblical language. He situates kerygma within a range of interconnected theories beginning with a series of linguistic phases which determine our ability to achieve spiritual apotheosis. In this schema, kerygma is closest to poetic language and farthest from conceptual and descriptive expression which objectify the Divine and prevent authentic inter-subjective encounters. Ultimately, however, kerygma is argued to be from beyond the poetic since it has more spiritual potency than most secular literature which remains hypothetical. A true kerygmatic breakthrough engenders a cooperative creative vision involving the human and the Divine experienced in the human imagination. Frye considers such a breakthrough to be at least possible in non-sacred expression, exemplified by the work of Stéphane Mallarmé and Martin Buber. Frye’s schemata are typically worked out through his adaptation of the Hegelian Aufhebung. This is apparent in Frye’s modes of language and Phases of Revelation, where his typological perspective is also set out. The phases culminate with the Participating Apocalypse which ideally is the reader’s total and immediate apprehension of the entirety of biblical narrative and symbolism. The resulting elevation of consciousness is related to Frye’s concept of Interpenetration where all aspects of reality, including the Divine, are experienced simultaneously in a full flourishing of the Spirit. Frye’s theoria intersects tangentially several aspects of mainstream theology. His dialectical development of Dante’s adaptation of the four senses of Scripture informs his own views of polysemous meaning, and his rejection of Bultmann’s demythologization project is a stepping stone to his identification of myth as the foundation of all linguistic expression, including biblical texts. Frye also positions his theory of primary concerns in sympathetic contrast to Paul Tillich’s ultimate concern. Perhaps most significantly, he posits analogia visionis as a potential alternative to the orthodox analogia entis and analogia fidei. Here, as throughout, Frye’s views are profoundly influenced by the Romantic poet William Blake who rejects many aspects of traditional religious thought. In the end, Frye considers himself to be a pure critic unrestricted by the usual categories of theology and philosophy, and it is suggested that he should be read in that light.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Sex and Sexual Misbehaviours: The Portrayal of Sex in Clerical Writings of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Rousseau, Maude</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis will argue that texts written by clerics in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries discussing sex heavily encouraged celibacy by warning people away from sexual misbehaviours and highlighting the negative consequences that could occur if one were to follow their lust. Although these texts were, for the most part, originally written with a clerical audience in mind, this research highlights the widening of an audience beyond Clerical, leading to different interpretations of these writings and on some occasions a disconnect in ideas about sex between the writings done by clerics and the lay audience that reads them. Firstly, I will argue that texts drawing inspiration from Greek and Roman authors highlight the tragic consequences that befall someone who allows love and lust to overpower their reason, strongly advising their readers to stay away from these feelings and to remain celibate. Fabliaux used humour to show their readers similar consequences of having affairs and committing sexual misbehaviours through characters such as the promiscuous priest and examples of couples having sex on holy grounds. Statutes and canon law are shown to have great concern for sexual sins such as fornication and adultery, discussing these sins in an obviously negative light, and confession manuals reinforce the consequences of priests and other figures not enforcing and respecting the goal of chastity. Finally, visitation reports and ecclesiastical court records show concerns for sexual sins, also depicting illicit and extramarital sex in a particularly negative manner, but also highlight an important disconnect between these texts written by clerics and lay people’s sexual practices, such as the frequency of lay people having sex outside of marriage, which shows a tendency to ignore the rules of chastity before marriage.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Juvenalia or Birdsong for Sheyne Meydelech, a collection of short stories, is a new existentialist riff on the complexities of the feminine coming-of-age in a postmodern society. These stories explore the tradition of the Bildungsroman in a postmodernist context. The coming-of-age experience in the twenty-first century is innately fragmented. Childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, and past, present, and future are weakly linked by memories of before and after: before the internet, before phones, before dating apps, before COVID, before hook-up culture, before this. My collection is an exploration of the experience of contemporaneity through the eyes of a young woman. The stories are unified by their treatment of alienation. My collection identifies alienation as the primary effect of the rapid evolution of technology and its equally rapid integration into our lives. 

In tone, the stories are rosy and sad, cynical but earnest; tragicomedy is the only mode through which I might dutifully reproduce my experience of postmodern life. These stories are concerned with plot, particularly its capacity to serve as a microcosm for the competing forces of self-determination and destiny. I enact metafiction as a tool to argue against the existence of free will as a factor in the life of the twenty-first century woman. Technology has proliferated in such a way that life now holds an infinitude of possibilities and appears as infinitely fragmented. Furthermore, absurdism and surrealism emerge as the only lenses through which a young woman might perceive a world still replete with wonder and the hope for narrative coherence. 

Just as the collection’s fragmented world precludes its narrative cohesion, so too does the routine immersion of our consciousness into the internet preclude the possibility of an exclusively realist mode. As such, the collection operates predominantly through realist narratives which invariably branch into softly magic realism, surrealism, or fantasy. At their heart, these stories boil down to the problem of alienation and the desire for connection; they are informed by pain but reach for levity.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring the Impact of Natural Disasters on U.S. Insurance Companies: 
An Empirical Analysis</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>Natural disasters, Insurance companies, Cumulative abnormal returns (CAR)s, Event Study, Market reactions</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>In this study, we investigate the impact of natural disasters on the stock prices of U.S. 
insurance companies from 2010 to 2022. Using a sample of hurricanes, wildfires, and 
tornadoes, we conduct an event study to analyze the market reactions to these events and 
examine why some insurance firms are more affected than others. Our findings indicate that 
natural disasters tend to result in negative abnormal returns for insurance firms, with stock 
prices dropping significantly around the events. Yet, the price declines are followed by a brief 
recovery period after the disaster has ended. The study highlights key factors affecting 
insurers’ market performance during such events: firms with higher leverage, lower net 
income, and a lower market valuation perform worse than their respective counterparts.
Additionally, we find that disasters with large insured damage amounts as well as hurricanes 
invoke larger negative market reactions. Furthermore, we observe that natural disasters have 
a significant impact on an insurer’s accounting performance. Specifically, disasters cause a 
significant decline in an insurer’s Return on Assets (ROA), with variations based on the 
insured damages stemming from a disaster and the insurer’s ex-ante financial performance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Transaction Graph Analysis for Bitcoin Address Classification: Traditional Supervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Saeidimanesh, Seyedarash</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, we consider the problem of Bitcoin address classification and clustering, common in the domains of law enforcement and regulatory compliance. We build a machine learning-based classification framework which is able to attribute a Bitcoin address to one of the predefined classes or to a specific company. We consider five distinct classes for coarse-grained classification: cryptocurrency exchanges, online marketplaces, mining pools, fundraising/charity platforms, and gambling; and 180 companies for fine-grained classification. Classes and the companies were selected so that they represent a broad spectrum of entities and activities within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
This thesis has three main contributions. First, due to the lack of publicly available datasets suitable for testing machine-learning classification algorithms, we create our own labeled dataset consisting of 3M Bitcoin addresses (from 2016-2022), with each Bitcoin address assigned a ready-to-use vector of carefully crafted features. Second, using this dataset, we conduct a comparative analysis of different machine-learning techniques and features for classification. Finally, we develop
two types of classifiers: based on the Boosted tree algorithm and the neural network-based classifier. Both are able to attribute a Bitcoin address to one of the predefined classes/companies. Our binary classification model achieves an F1 score of 76% using the Boosted tree algorithm, while our deep learning model achieves a 90% F1 score for multi-class classification with an accuracy of 92% and 28% higher than related work correspondingly. We achieve 67% accuracy for linking Bitcoin addresses to one of the 180 companies with our deep-learning model.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Integrating Handwriting Analysis and Machine Learning for Enhanced Personality Trait Prediction</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Safar, Maedeh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis presents an in-depth exploration of graphology and its integration with machine learning to analyze personality traits through handwriting. The motivation for this research stems from the brain's ability to express personality traits through neuromuscular movements, particularly in handwriting. This study bridges the historical graphological methods, tracing back to the 19th century, with contemporary machine learning techniques. 
This research utilized a dataset of 1,108 handwriting examples. CENPARMI contributed 234 of these, while the remaining 874 were procured through a business-oriented graphology expert. The data used comprises a diverse set of handwriting samples, analyzed using machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and specifically the VGG16 model for transfer learning. The research employs techniques like SMOTE for data balancing and ensemble methods for classification, including Majority Voting and Stacking Method. 
Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of personality trait predictions after using SMOTE, with the highest accuracy exceeding 90% for traits like "Agreeableness" and "Open to Experience" using the Ensemble method (Stacking Method). Thus, this integrated approach produces better results. 
The main contributions of this research lie in its innovative integration of graphology and machine learning for personality assessment, methodological advancements in handling imbalanced datasets, and the application of transfer learning in handwriting analysis. The improved accuracy in personality trait prediction illustrates the potential of this interdisciplinary approach in fields such as psychology and personalized services, offering new insights into personality psychology and opening avenues for future research in this domain.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Understanding Crack Formation in IN738 Alloy Fabricated by Laser Powder Bed Fusion and Heat Treatment Process</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Safizadeh, Sara</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Cracking often occurs after Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) due to residual stresses from the manufacturing process. To mitigate these stresses, post-processing methods like stress relief Heat Treatment (HT) are used. This study combines computational and experimental methods to analyze and predict macro crack behavior in two geometries—dog bone and cruciform—fabricated from LPBF IN738 alloy. The objective is to understand and predict macro crack formation following LPBF and HT to prevent cracking. A coupled thermomechanical analysis was conducted to identify locations and timing of stress concentrations in the geometries. A simulation workflow was developed quantifying residual stresses at various stages of LPBF and HT. Fracture analysis using the stress intensity factor, a parameter in fracture mechanics, was performed to predict crack formation. Both numerical simulations and experimental validations were employed to assess this approach's effectiveness. Results showed that the stress intensity factor at stress concentration sites exceeded IN738's fracture toughness, indicating potential cracks. Despite geometric differences, both geometries showed similar stress peak patterns and crack behavior. High stress concentrations were observed early in the build process, during HT, and after cooling. The study also examined the impact of post-process sequences, such as HT and base plate removal, on geometric accuracy. These findings provide insights for designing geometries to prevent cracking and emphasize the role of geometric features and process sequencing in optimizing additive manufacturing. Understanding the relationship between design, residual stresses, and process sequences aids in developing robust design strategies and post-processing techniques to enhance LPBF component designs.</etd_ms:description>

Evidence from Canada</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The relationship between socioeconomic factors and mental health has garnered significant attention, revealing complex connections between economic conditions and psychological well-being. This paper studies the impact of family economic conditions on the mental health of Canadian adolescents using data from the 2017-2018 wave of the Canadian Community Health Survey. To analyze this relationship, a latent variable indicative of economic conditions is created from several indicators of households’ living standard. This latent variable, along with demographic and behavioral factors, is used in an ordinal logistic regression model to evaluate its effect on mental health outcomes. The findings highlight that older adolescents and females experience notably worse mental health. Behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, negatively impact mental well-being, while physical activity is positively associated. Although economic factors significantly influence mental health, they are not the primary determinants of mental well-being among Canadian adolescents.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Effect of Water Vapor and Hydrogen Exposure on Tribological Performance of Inconel 718 for Next-Generation Gas Turbine Engine</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Saikat, Istiak Mahmud</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Nickel-based superalloys (i.e., 718) are widely used in the aerospace industry because of their exceptional mechanical and chemical stability at high temperatures. With recent advances in sustainable aviation, there is growing interest in investigating their compatibility with hydrogen combustion and water vapor in gas turbine engines. In this study, the tribological behavior of Inconel 718 was investigated under dry and water vapor conditions at various temperatures. In addition, the friction and wear behavior of hydrogen exposed Inconel 718 was studied at room temperature (RT ~25°C). Reciprocating ball on flat type tribometer was used to perform friction tests on Inconel 718 against aluminum oxide and Inconel 718 counter surfaces in the absence or presence of water vapor at room and elevated temperatures. However, only the Inconel 718 counterball was used for the dry sliding test for hydrogen-exposed samples. The results showed that water vapor caused a reduction in friction and wear at room and elevated temperatures of 450oC against the aluminum oxide counterball when compared to tests conducted under dry conditions. The low friction and wear in water vapor was attributed to the formation of an aluminum trihydroxide (bayerite—Al(OH)3) tribofilm. On the other hand, Inconel 718 against Inconel 718 showed higher wear in the presence of water vapor at RT compared to that in dry conditions. Conversely, water vapor decreased wear at HT compared to HT dry (where RT is ~25°% and HT is 450°C). Higher wear was attributed to the lack of sufficient lubricious oxide film formation on the wear tracks for Inconel 718 against Inconel 718 at HT. On the other hand, similar tribological behavior (i.e. friction and wear) was observed for the hydrogen-exposed and unexposed Inconel 718 at room temperature ambient conditions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Certification Effect: Stamp of Approval or Just Another Anomaly?</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The relation between analyst publications and their effects on the underlying stocks is a well-researched field of finance. However, none go so far as to identify the fundamental effect of a firm receiving its first recommendation from an analyst beyond standard recommendation
effects. We examine a sample of 6168 analyst initiation of coverage events, separated into a positive subsample and negative subsample to determine the abnormal returns generated in the two days after, one-month after, and one year after event windows using an event study methodology. In addition, we compare these abnormal returns to those generated by a respective control subsample of mid-caps to calculate the certification effect. Finally, we study the relationship the different event window certification effects have with firm-level variables. We
find that the abnormal returns generated by the small-caps are consistently different than those generated by the respective control subsample of mid-caps, and that the certification effects are
significantly non-zero values. We also find that the short certification effect has no relationship with firm level variables, while mid and long certification effects have a relationship with Board Size. We fail to establish a relationship between the mid and long certification effects and the change of stock volatility of the underlying firm. We conclude that while the certification effect does exist in the short-term, its effect is lost in the long-term as new events take place and confound the results.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores teachers' perspectives and approaches to addressing peer harm incidents in educational settings through a qualitative analysis of their narratives. Employing thematic analysis of in-depth individual interviews and a focus group with eight teachers from a public school in Bogotá, Colombia, two overarching themes were identified: 1) Teachers’ philosophies: Reflecting on navigating tensions between different concerns while centering students’ needs, and 2) Teachers recognize that harms occur in complex social contexts thus requiring collaboration with the larger community. The first theme highlighted teachers' tensions between following protocols and adapting to individual circumstances when addressing peer harm. They prioritized proactive strategies, restorative approaches, and considered students' perspectives to support their development. The second theme revealed teachers' understanding that students' behavior is shaped by family dynamics and sociocultural factors such as socioeconomics and peer pressure, necessitating a holistic and contextualized approach to address peer harm and promote positive relationships. In this complex educational landscape, the virtue of prudence was identified as a valuable lens for understanding teachers' interventions. This approach offers both structure and flexibility, aligning well with the teachers’ student-centered philosophies. These findings provide deeper insights into the challenges of managing student conflicts and underscore the human element of the teaching profession.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The scholarly fields of geography and sociology have identified time as an important factor shaping the policy design that instruct the flow of migrants, however this phenomenon remains sparsely investigated in the political science discourse. Considering this gap in the literature of migration studies and political science, this thesis operationalizes temporal governance in the Canadian policy design context as a tool of control and investigates its differential application in the categories of skilled migrants, family sponsorship and refugees and asylum seekers. To address this gap, I use Melanie Griffith’s coined term, “temporal governance” to assert that time is used as a policy tool to design permissive and restrictive eligibility criteria and it is used differently across Canada’s permanent immigration categories: economic migration, family sponsorship and refugee sponsorship. Second, I use Schneider and Ingram’s social constructions theory to assert that the temporally permissive and restrictive policy design reveals that the economic migration receives permissive policy treatment based on their positive social constructions and usefulness in achieving the state’s economic immigration objectives. Whereas family sponsorship and refugee sponsorship receive restrictive policy treatment due to their weak political associations. Ultimately, this policy design decides which categories are more “deserving by design”.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The origins of postcolonial discourses in Poland today are connected to a prevalent feeling among Poles that Poland itself has been an ‘overlooked’ victim of colonialism. In relation to the contemporary discourse on ’care and repair,’ this research-creation engages with the emotional and epistemological dilemmas inherent to showcasing Poland’s entanglement with the ‘global colonial power matrix’. In this written component of my thesis, I present a review of current practices within Poland’s art scenes to illustrate how coloniality is both reproduced and challenged in Polish museums. Subsequently, I reflect on my creative process behind producing the exhibition Jarring Lots. Drawing on Édouard Glissant, the name of the exhibition is a linguistic and conceptual reference to the fermentation of dill pickles and the transformative potential of opacit. Ultimately, this research-creation proposes that what is lacking in Poland’s exhibitions are decolonial gestures focused on taking care of the country’s racialised communities.</etd_ms:description>

Vibration-based Damage Detection and Localization in Pipelines Using Data Analysis
Mohammadsajad Salimi
Pipelines are important indicators of modern infrastructure, which allow for easy transportation of significant resources like gas, water, and petroleum over long distances. They often cross very sensitive environments, and any damage to them poses severe and irreversible consequences for marine ecosystems. Also, global warming brings deterioration in infrastructure, which calls for urgent needs for advanced monitoring and maintenance solutions. Their challenges bring about the development of efficient and practical systems to meet the current and future demands of industry. This research focuses on the prediction of pipeline behavior through the vibration signals as a primary method for detection, location, and showing the difference in the extent of damage. Methods like this provide critical details about pipe structural integrity and hence notify early stages of a possible problem well before failure occurs.  In this work, pipeline conditions were simulated with numerical modeling using the ANSYS software and then validated with experimental data. Features extracted from sensors were specifically velocity and acceleration. Analysis was done by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which tries to diffuse data complexity and emphasizes only the most significant variations, where the first principal component carries the most critical information about pipeline conditions and is used as our desirable feature. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as a method for finding statistically independent components for refining the data is used for detection phase. Application of ICA in this area helps maximize the detection rate for anomalies such as corrosion or structural damage. Then, it combines Mahalanobis distance and K-nearest neighbor methods to accurately localize damage in the pipeline. Initial results using data reveal that the algorithm works well, hence may be applied to real life.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>“When Cooking Japanese Style, It Helps If You Have An American Friend”: American Cold War Discourse on Japanese Cuisine, 1945-1992</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Salvail-Lacoste, Eloi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the evolution in American discourse on Japanese cooking from the end of World War II through the end of the Cold War. During this time of important changes and tensions in US-Japan relations, Japanese cuisine went from a niche, exotic novelty to a monument of fine dining. Nevertheless, that discourse remained largely static throughout the period. This stasis is imputable to the fact that, at least on a national level, white, educated, upper-middle class writers —rather than Japanese-Americans— popularized Japanese cuisine in the United States. Those writers often perpetuated older Orientalist tropes and used Japanese cuisine as a mean to accrue cultural capital and perform a form of cosmopolitanism that had become fashionable during the Cold War era. This research is based on the analysis of cookbooks, restaurant reviews, mostly from the New York Times, and magazines articles from Gourmet and Bon Appétit published between 1945 and 1992.�</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Unsupervised Learning Based on Multivariate Libby-Novick Beta Mixture Model for Medical Data Analysis</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Samiee, Niloufar</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis proposes a set of innovative clustering techniques that lever- age finite and infinite mixture models to analyze medical data and images of cells. The proposed approaches are designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of clustering in these domains. These models utilize a flexible distribution, the Libby-Novick Beta distribution, to better model data with varying shapes due to an additional shape parameter compared to the con- ventional Beta distribution. In this study, our initial approach involves the use of deterministic learning techniques, with a focus on maximum likelihood using the expectation-maximization approach. To achieve accurate data rep- resentation in unsupervised learning, it is crucial to determine the optimal number of clusters. So, we expand the minimum message length (MML) principle to ascertain the number of clusters in Libby-Novick Beta mixtures. In order to overcome the challenge of estimating the number of mixture components, we extend our finite mixture model to an infinite one. Nonparametric Bayesian techniques can effectively capture data distribution with an unknown number of components. This approach is useful for complex data sets and can lead to more accurate predictions and better decision-making. Our models are evaluated for different medical applications throughout the entire process, and they consistently show superior performance over traditional alternatives. This study reveals the significance of the Libby-Novick Beta distribution and the recommended mixture models in converting medical data into practical insights. This conversion aids healthcare professionals in making more accurate decisions, thereby advancing the overall healthcare field.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Story is Everywhere: Polish Jewish Children and Adolescents in Soviet Central Asia during the Second World War</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Samson, Marie-Odile</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Close to 80 percent of all Polish Jews still alive in 1945 survived outside Poland, either deported to or exiled in Soviet territories, yet their life stories have been overlooked in much of Holocaust historiography (Goldlust, 2012). This thesis examines young survivors’ intimate experiences of exile and deportation in the Soviet Central Asian Republics during the Second World War. Anchored in oral testimonies from the Montreal Holocaust Museum by survivors who were children or adolescents during the war, I explore youths’ journeys to and within the region as well as their relationships with local populations and family members during this period. In the first chapter, I argue that children and youth faced particular dangers of displacement specific to their age groups, and examine the impact of famine, illness, and interrupted education on their experiences, as well as the psychological consequences of these movements. The second chapter holds that children and youth connected with local populations in a manner different from adult refugees, often forging close bonds and friendship and displaying a notable sense of solidarity with local residents. The third chapter, finally, turns to the presence and absence of family members during young people’s wartime displacements, directing attention to the role of age in shaping family dynamics and highlighting the divergent experiences of children and adolescents. Overall, this work aims to bring attention to young people’s unique and distinct experiences of deportation and exile in the Soviet Union.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Impact of Linguistic Anti-patterns on Program Comprehension</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sanei, Farideh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Understanding a software system is a major activity during the maintenance and evolution of the system. Researchers studied how developers understand source code and which factors reduce program comprehension. They reported that shorter identifier names have a negative impact on program comprehension. The use of short identifiers is a symptom of a broader naming problem. Consequently, researchers introduced linguistic anti-patterns (LAs) to describe bad practices in the naming, documentation, and implementation of code entities, which can have a negative impact on program comprehension. In this study, we make the hypothesis that LAs have a small impact on program comprehension because they can be easily recognised by developers. To test our hypothesis, we conducted an empirical study to investigate whether the occurrences of LAs do indeed affect code comprehension by asking participants to perform comprehension tasks on code containing or not occurrences of LAs, with and without prior knowledge of LAs. We also examined whether participants could recognise LAs by identifying them in various code snippets and assessed the ease of LA recognition with and without prior knowledge. We also evaluate the impact of knowledge of LA on program comprehension and LA recognition. We measured participants’ performance (1) in comprehension tasks using the correctness of their answers, time spent, and perceived effort and (2) in recognition tasks also using correctness. Our findings indicate that, while LAs do impact program comprehension, this impact is small or negligible because LAs are recognised by developers. They also show that learning about LAs can mitigate their negative impact by improving their recognition rates. We thus conclude with the possible negative result that linguistic antipatterns may not actually function as antipatterns, given their minimal impact on program comprehension.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Learning with artificial intelligence: how students decide and then use AI</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Saraf, Kapil</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education, focusing on how and why students incorporate AI tools like ChatGPT into their studies. While AI's impact on the workplace has been extensively researched, its role in education remains less understood. This study addresses this gap through a qualitative analysis of 27 students' experiences with AI in their academic pursuits.

The research reveals that students engage in complex ethical decision-making when choosing to use AI, balancing its potential for educational advancement against concerns about skill development and managing academic pressures. Two primary patterns of AI usage emerge: replacement and support.

By comparing AI use in education with its application in the workplace, this thesis highlights the unique challenges and opportunities presented by AI in academic settings. The findings have significant implications for students, educational institutions, and society at large, emphasizing the need for responsible AI use, clear guidelines, and the importance of preparing students for an AI-driven future while maintaining core educational values.
This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI in education.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Constitutionalizing the Rights of Nature: The Case of Canada's Old-Growth Forests in Comparative Perspective</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sarah, Aldinger</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Rights of nature, constitutional environmental rights, old-growth forests, Indigenous legal orders, British Columbia</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper explores what the inclusion of constitutional environmental rights (CERs), specifically the rights of nature (RoN), could look like in Canada and their potential impact on the protection of endangered old-growth forests in British Columbia (BC). BC is home to some of the last remaining old-growth forests in Canada. While deemed essential by the province to the forestry industry, intact higher productivity old-growth forests hold significant cultural, social, and economic values, and play critical ecological functions on which BC’s biodiversity depends. Despite this, old-growth logging persists in the province, culminating in Canada’s largest act of civil disobedience: the Fairy Creek Blockades. Reflective of recurrent trends in BC’s forestry practices from Clayoquot Sound’s “War in the Woods,” this mobilization demands the need for stronger environmental regulations and oversight in Canada. Though CER provisions positively correlate with environmental outcomes, these rights hierarchize human property over nature’s right to exist, flourish, or be restored. I explore a potential avenue for protecting the rights of old-growth forests in BC: the stand-alone rights of nature in the Canadian Constitution. By examining rights of nature laws in Ecuador, Bolivia, and New Zealand, I will investigate what the constitutional RoN could look like in Canada. These rights might not only ensure the sustained protection of old-growth ecosystems in BC but incorporate Indigenous worldviews and legal orders into Canada’s dominant legal system.

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the influence of international migration on the operational performance of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Canada. This study focuses on the relationship between international migrants and the operational performance of Canadian REITs. An exposure to international migration measure is built using the weight of properties held by REITs in different provinces and the international migrants in the respective province. The findings reveal that an increase in the exposure to net non-permanent residents will increase the operational performance of Canadian REITs. Furthermore, the implementation of Bill-28 in British-Colombia and NRST in Ontario results in REITs residential exposure to net non-permanent residents decreasing the operational performance in each respective region. This thesis contributes to the understanding of how demographic shifts, specifically international migration, affect REITs operational performances.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>New Estimates of Snow Water Availability in the Northern Regions of North America.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sarpong, Robert</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Earth System reanalysis, snow variables, ERA5-Land, Benchmarking, Canada and Alaska.</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Seasonal snow has a crucial role on freshwater supply in mountainous regions and high latitudes.  The advent of remote sensing data and Earth System reanalysis products has opened enormous opportunities for estimating snow water availability at larger scales. Despite these technological advancements, still estimating the water stored in snow and determining its variability in space and time pose major challenges. One major issue is limitations in the benchmarking studies and the fact that while several new datasets are introduced, little is known about their accuracy, reliability and robustness. The second issue is related to the way that water stored in the snowpack is assessed using the concept of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). Most importantly, maximum annual SWE does not reflect the losses of snow water during winter melts– a phenomenon that has become widespread due to the rising temperature and more frequent winter rain as a result of climate change. In addition, SWE does not take into account snow cover extent, and therefore cannot distinguish whether changes in stored water in the snow correspond to changes in snow depth or snow cover. To address the first challenge, a formal benchmarking is performed to test three key snow fields of a newly released reanalysis product, ERA5-Land, over the area of Canada and Alaska, ~9% of global land in which snow processes have a critical role on water supply. The considered snow variables are snow depth, snow cover and SWE, from which snow density can be also retrieved. The ERA5-Land’s snow depth and SWE fields are intercompared with Canadian Meteorological Centre’s (CMC’s) snow depth and SWE, whereas snow cover field is tested against MODIS satellite observations as the reference. Special care is made to assess how spatial and temporal patterns of change and persistence are reconstructed using ERA5-Land’s snow field over 21 ecological regions that cover the domain. In addition, the spatial patterns discrepancies between ERA5-Land’s snow fields and corresponding reference products are explored to inspect whether they entail there is any significant dependence with latitude, longitude and elevation, which points to a systematic bias in ERA5-Land data. Based on this benchmarking attempt, it is advised against the use of ERA5-Land’s snow depth and SWE estimates in Canada and Alaska, while estimates of snow cover and snow density can be still used although with cautions, particularly for local assessments, which may require bias-correction. To address the second challenge, a new and more physically-appealing metric, Snow Water Availability (SWA), is defined that take into account snow cover extent in conjunction with snow depth and snow density. Based on the findings of the benchmarking attempt, four monthly estimates of SWA are established over Canada and Alaska by integrating CMC snow depth fields with ERA5-Lands’s and CMC’s snow density as well as MODIS’s and ERA5-Land’s snow cover during the water years of 2000 to 2020 at 25×25 km2 spatial resolution. Using these SWA estimates, the implications on water availability over 25 drainage regions in Canada and Alaska are explored and discussed. It is concluded that while Canada and Alaska as a whole has gained substantial amount of SWA during the study period, the strategically important drainage regions in western Canada have lost substantial amount of SWA since the beginning of the century. This can jeopardize regional water resource management in some of the world’s most important food baskets in Canadian Prairies, revealing the urgency for regional adaptation to maintain the water, food and energy security in Canada.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Thermoplastics are particularly well suited to the aerospace industry because of their superior mechanical properties and shelf-life when compared to thermosets. When manufacturing thermoplastic composite parts using automated fiber placement (AFP) technology, the high processing temperature and non-uniform cooling causes residual process stresses to arise. Constituent level or ply level stresses are residual stresses that come from interactions inherent to the composite system. They would be present in this carbon fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone (PEEK) material system regardless of the manufacturing method. Residual process stresses are laminate level stresses that arise from an external process, like AFP manufacturing.
AFP manufactured parts can include flat panels with free edges and fully constrained geometries like rings and cylinders. They express their residual stresses somewhat differently: flat panels will warp visibly as they cool, while the stresses present in rings will only be visible once they have been slit along their length. They will visibly spring in or out.
The goal of this thesis was to see if it was possible to use annealing to relieve the residual process stresses from thermoplastic composite structures manufactured using AFP without compromising laminate properties. These properties included crystallinity, void content, and fiber volume fraction. It would seem that the residual stresses in unidirectional panels with free edges can be mostly relieved with annealing. A 3-hour hold at 200˚C brought them to within 2mm of flat. However, the radii and spring-in or spring-out behavior of hoop-wound and asymmetric rings remained unaffected.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Procurement of Public-private partnerships (P3), Environmental, social, and governance (ESG), Social infrastructure projects, and Analytical Hierarchy Structure (AHP)</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis studies the necessary shift in screening practices of public-private partnerships (P3) projects in Canada, moving beyond traditional qualitative criteria to include broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) project objectives. The current P3 screening, while effective, needs adaptation to align with Canadian societal and environmental infrastructure goals. In response, this thesis focuses on three objectives aimed at improving social infrastructure P3 procurement and promoting sustainable and responsible project management practices for these projects. Firstly, it identifies and describes Canadian-specific ESG criteria important for ensuring responsible sustainability in delivering social infrastructure projects. Secondly, it develops an ESG-PPP screening matrix to evaluate social infrastructure projects based on responsible sustainability thresholds, determining their suitability for P3 procurement. Thirdly, it implements a multi-criteria analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the most appropriate P3 model for social infrastructure projects, considering the identified ESG criteria and quantitative value-for-money criterion. The AHP-PPP selection tool is applied to three case studies analyzing two AHP scales to assess their consistency ratios and the reliability of the P3 selection results. The results indicate that the balanced-n scale exhibit lower inconsistency ratios compared to the fundamental AHP scale, and decisions on P3 options remained consistent across all case studies using both scales, suggesting that the Fundamental AHP scale remains reliable if decision-makers accurately reflect the relative importance of P3 options. Overall, this thesis addresses the increasing need for sustainable and responsible management of social infrastructure projects in Canada by integrating ESG factors into the current procurement process.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Shafeii, Alexandre</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Chemotherapies are the leading treatment for late-stage cancers. Despite their efficacy, these treatments are known to have harsh side effects caused by poor selectivity for cancerous cells over healthy cells. For this reason, the exploration of molecular targets specific to cancer cells is crucial for improving chemotherapies.
In preliminary studies, thienoisoquinolines have shown selective biological activity against lung cancer cells. Microscopy studies of cells treated with a leading thienoisoquinoline derivative exhibited arrested mitosis and disruptions within the microtubules. Additional experimentation via an in vitro microtubule polymerization assay and competition studies indicate that this lead compound has high binding affinity to microtubules at the colchicine site.
With these results, we aimed to further optimize the lead compound 75 (C75) to generate more drug-like molecules and confirm its mode of action through substrate alteration. In order to facilitate candidate modification, new synthetic approaches have been developed for enhanced modularity. This has generated new derivatives for structure-activity relationship studies, as well as provided access to wider range of derivatives for future pull-down assays, with the aim of identifying the specific biomolecular target of thienoisoquinoline derivatives with anti-cancer activity. Notably, the benzylic position is a major contributor to degradation of these molecules in biological assays. A newly devised synthetic route overcame the challenges in functionalization of this position, allowing for the production of more drug-like derivatives which will hopefully have increased biological activity. This was done in conjunction with kinetic solubility measurements and degradation studies in order to streamline the production of more efficacious compounds.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Synergetic Wastewater Treatment: Implementing Annamox Enhanced Wastewater in Closed Loop Pressure Retarded Osmosis for Sustainable Energy Generation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shah, Vidit Hetal</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Exploring the symbiotic potential of wastewater treatment and sustainable energy generation, this research integrates an Anammox (Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation) reactor with Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO). The investigation considers three diverse feed solutions: Deionized (DI) water, synthetic water, and a composite of synthetic water with real mine wastewater from gold mines. The study assesses the nitrogen removal efficiency in the Anammox reactor, accounting for the distinctive compositions of each feed solution. Concurrently, the power output, and overall performance of the PRO system are analyzed using the Anammox reactor effluent as the feed solution.
DI water provides a baseline for comparison, synthetic water replicates-controlled conditions, and the inclusion of mine wastewater introduces real-world complexities. The present study critically examines the chemical interactions occurring within an integrated system, focusing on the observable impact of trace elements present in gold mine wastewater on both biological and osmotic processes.
The research provides valuable insights into the interaction between biological nitrogen removal and osmotic power generation across varied wastewater matrices. Results highlight the versatility of the proposed methodology, underscoring its practical significance for sustainable energy production in mining environments.
Initially for experiments on lab-scale PRO setup, solutions of NaCl, KCl, (NH4)2CO3 and MgCl2 were used as the draw solutions. Results from this exploration offer valuable considerations for wastewater treatment and energy production in gold mining operations, highlighting the potential for sustainable practices in resource-intensive industries. After examining different draw solutions, synthetic water and composite of synthetic water with real mine tailing water were tested with 3M (NH4)2CO3 as the draw solution which produced the average power density of 11.0 ± 0.5 W⁄m2 and fouling was observed within the timespan. Results demonstrated promising power generation capabilities, with significant reductions in ion concentrations in the permeate, indicating the effectiveness of the PRO process. Recommendations for future research include comprehensive techno-economic analyses, exploration of advanced membrane technologies, and integration of other bioremediation techniques to enhance pollutant removal and system performance. Overall, the integration of Annamox-PRO represents a promising approach towards enhancing sustainability, energy efficiency, and environmental stewardship in industrial settings, particularly in challenging environments like mining operations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Identity and agency play pivotal roles in shaping teachers' commitment, involvement, and personal autonomy throughout their professional growth journey. This literature-based thesis seeks to explore the creation of transformative professional learning experiences to foster the positive growth of non-native English-speaking teachers’ (NNESTs) identity and agency. It begins by addressing challenges in defining NNEST's professional identity and reevaluating current notions of NNEST's growth. Shifting the discussion to NNEST growth, the thesis examines the interconnectedness of identity and agency. This study argues for a broader understanding of transformative learning as a theoretical framework for supporting NNESTs. Drawing on transformative learning theory, the thesis suggests strategies for facilitation methods that empower NNESTs to realize their full potential in international education programs, particularly in TESOL (Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages). The research findings shed light on the negotiation of linguistic and cultural aspects, challenges faced by NNESTs, the role of discursive constructions, and teachers' emotional responses. Demonstrating how professional development can facilitate transformative learning, the study highlights the importance of creating supportive environments that encourage critical reflection and validate multiple identities. It also discusses implications for promoting positive identity construction and professional integration.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring Zoom as a Platform for Language Learning: An Interactionist Approach</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shamsipour, Nasrin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Video Conferencing tools like Zoom have provided new avenues for authentic learner interaction in second language (L2) learning, supporting research that highlights the role of interaction in facilitating L2 acquisition (e.g., Putri et al., 2021; Swain, 1985). For instance, according to Long’s (1996 et seq.) Interactionist Approach, it is hypothesized that learners acquire language most effectively when they engage in meaningful communication and negotiate meaning with others. Zoom aligns with this approach by providing authentic virtual interaction opportunities (Zhao &amp; Lai, 2023).
This study draws upon Cardoso’s (2022) chronological framework for examining technological tools for L2 learning. Specifically, it focuses on stage 2 of the framework, which involves assessing the pedagogical potential of an existing technology. Following Long’s (1996) Interactive Approach, the study explored how Zoom’s features can be leveraged to promote interactions by providing learners with access to the L2 input (e.g., listening) and promoting opportunities for output (e.g., speaking) and negotiation of meaning (e.g., to solve a communication breakdown). Our analysis suggests that most Zoom features fulfil the criteria set forth by the Interaction Approach. For instance, Breakout Rooms and Polls/Quizzes have the potential to increase student engagement and provide immediate feedback. Students can also collaborate in Video Conferencing and Chats within Breakout Rooms to engage in meaningful exchanges that drive L2 learning. Our discussion of these analyses highlights Zoom’s potential as a versatile platform for language learning, offering significant benefits for both synchronous and asynchronous L2 learning.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In this study, the challenge of detecting fake reviews in e-commerce is addressed through the application of natural language processing and deep learning techniques. The paper introduces two frameworks designed to identify fraudulent reviews, a critical concern due to their impact on consumer behavior and market dynamics. Central to this study is the exploitation of rating-sentiment inconsistency (RSI), a nuanced textual feature indicative of potential deception, aimed at enhancing the detection of fake content. Using a dataset of Amazon reviews, the paper evaluates two distinct approaches. The first method integrates RSI with word embeddings, specifically GloVe and Word2Vec, yielding an accuracy improvement of 3.07% for GloVe and 0.67% for Word2Vec, demonstrating the effectiveness of BiGRUs in capturing the sequential nature of textual data. The second method incorporates inconsistency features into Doc2Vec representations, achieving a 1.55% increase in accuracy compared to models without this feature. Both methodologies benefit from grid search optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters, enhancing model performance significantly. These combination methods not only underscore the importance of content-based feature integration but also demonstrate the practical application of inconsistency metrics in fake review detection. The observed improvements in model accuracy confirm the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, providing new insights into enhancing online review system integrity and advancing natural language processing in commercial settings.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Repetitive Financial Ads on Social Media Shape Next-Gen Future Financial Experience: Why Financial Experts Should be Alert?</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sharma, Shubham</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Qualitative research, financial ads, social media, customer journey, marketing ethics</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Social media platforms allow financial institutions and advertisers to reach a broad audience and promote their offerings. Consequently, financial ads have become a common feature in social media feeds. Nevertheless, more knowledge is needed regarding the effects of these ads on the Next Gen customer journey (age and culture), who navigates through the complex financial ecosystem trying to make sense of these repetitive financial ads combined with the interference of social media influencers. This qualitative research explores the impact of repetitive financial advertisements on social media and their influence on the general perception of various age groups that compose the Next-Gen. The methodology consisted of an in-depth content analysis of financial influencers on social media and 15 in-depth interviews of participants from different demographic and culture groups who shared their detailed customer journey experiences, including attitudes and perceptions toward repetitive financial ads. The results of this study contribute to providing a better understanding of a) how exposure to repetitive financial ads shapes the customer’s attitude towards financial products and services, b) how variations in perceptions may depend on the customer’s age groups and cultural background, and c) how social media influencers combined with social media platforms selection may impact the customer’s financial literacy and perception on financial products and services. From a managerial perspective, the power of influencers and social media platforms within financial services should be evaluated beyond  

robotic information gathered by big data. Although the qualitative research limits the
aggregate results based on the snowball recruitment and the number of interviewees, it enriches the perspective of putting the human first by listening to the storytelling; it is possible to grasp how the customer engages in sharing, reading, and commenting about financial services and products on various social media platforms, and how the customer is influenced by “financial experts” who promote their expertise on these platforms. Ethical guidance is needed at all levels (e.g., customers, financial institutions, financial advertisers, marketers) to develop and achieve social media efficacy while tailoring educative financial communication strategies toward specific age and cultural groups.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring How AI Disclosure in Blog Posts Affects the Perceptions of Brand Warmth and Competence</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shayto, Mohamad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Marketers increasingly employ generative AI technologies in content creation. However, whether and how disclosing AI authorship may affect consumers’ brand perceptions remains underexplored. This thesis investigates the impact of disclosing whether marketing content was AI-generated or human-written, specifically on consumer perceptions of the brand’s warmth and competence. In general, I hypothesize that brand perceptions will be more negative when content (e.g., a blog post) is disclosed to be authored by AI compared to by a human. However, I theorize the effect may depend on whether the content is informational or narrative in nature, such that the negative impact of AI disclosure is expected to be greater for narrative content than informational content. These hypotheses were examined across two experiments. The results of Study 1 revealed that human-written content was perceived as warmer and more competent, enhancing brand credibility, brand attitude, and purchase intentions. Content type did not moderate these effects. Study 2 replicated the effect of disclosure on warmth, and additionally found that content type moderated this effect (although the moderation did not operate as expected). No significant effects on competence emerged in this study. Theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed, especially regarding the strategic use of human authorship in content marketing.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Heritage3DMtl: A Multi-modal UAV Dataset of Heritage Buildings for Digital Preservation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shende, Rucha</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has emerged as a transformative tool for 3D reconstruction, offering diverse applications in urban planning, heritage studies, infrastructure monitoring, and emergency response. Despite considerable progress, the field of heritage studies faces challenges due to the scarcity of real-world data tailored for heritage preservation. To address this gap, this thesis presents Heritage3DMtl, an extensive multi-modal dataset comprising 17 heritage buildings in Montreal, acquired using a UAV. The dataset includes images, estimated camera poses, and reconstructed 3D data (point clouds and meshes), providing great detail and diversity.

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for data collection is provided, demonstrating the efficient use of low-cost consumer-grade UAVs to capture heritage buildings. This SOP serves as a replicable blueprint for future similar efforts. Various 3D reconstruction techniques are explored and experimented with using the dataset. Additionally, the dataset's applicability is showcased through the reconstruction of Level of Detail (LOD) models in alignment with the CityGML standard.

Furthermore, the integration of advanced reconstruction techniques, such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, has revolutionized the way we visualize and interact with building sites in digital environments. These techniques enable the generation of photorealistic renderings as well as interactive 3D models, enhancing our ability to study and interpret heritage buildings with unprecedented fidelity and detail.

In summary, this work contributes to the discourse on 3D heritage reconstruction by introducing an open-source dataset that enhances resources available to researchers and practitioners. Heritage3DMtl facilitates advancements in the field and serves as a valuable asset for digital preservation efforts, providing a comprehensive foundation for future research and innovation in heritage documentation and 3D</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Resource efficient deep learning approaches for monaural
speech separation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Shi, Peiran</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Speech separation is a critical task in processing naturalistic audio streams, aiming to extract individual speech sources from mixed speech signals. Monaural speech separation, which deals with audio from a single microphone, focuses on isolating overlapping speech signals, a process essential for applications such as automatic speech recognition and voice assistant devices. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved speech separation, typically by training neural networks to estimate high-quality separated speech from mixed signals using supervised
learning. However, most state-of-the-art neural networks operate in the time domain and are computationally expensive due to their sequential processing methods and complex structures. Despite the common perception that time-domain models outperform those in the time-frequency domain, this thesis focuses on developing resource-efficient models in the time-frequency domain, aiming to enhance their performance within a deep learning framework. 

In the first contribution of this thesis, we propose RCFormer, a Conformer-based neural network with a redundancy approach, designed for monaural two-speaker speech separation. The RCFormer employs multiple pairs of intra-frame and sub-band Conformer blocks to successively capture both frame-level and sub-band-level information from the input spectrogram. To address the challenge of sparse information in the input spectrogram, a redundancy approach is introduced to create a denser representation by stacking the input spectrogram embeddings. The proposed architecture integrates Conformer blocks between a dilated dense convolutional encoder and decoder, with the Conformer block outputs fed into a masking module that generates masks to filter the encoder outputs, which are then transformed into separated speech signals via the decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCFormer achieves competitive, and often superior, performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics, while also featuring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

While many models achieve competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters, few researchers have addressed the computational workload and processing time associated with these models. In the second contribution of this thesis, we propose FSBNet for two-speaker speech separation, which integrates sub-band and full-band modules. FSBNet consists of an encoder, multiple full-band and sub-band blocks (FSB blocks), and a decoder. The FSB block features a sub-band module that extracts temporal information within each sub-band and computes high-level crossband dependencies through compact latent summaries, and a full-band module that captures longrange dependencies across the entire spectrogram using a self-attention mechanism. The contextual information obtained from the FSB blocks is then processed into two complex spectrograms representing the separated speech signals, which are re-synthesized into audio using the inverse short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT). Experimental results demonstrate that FSBNet achieves competitive performance compared to both time-domain and time frequency domain approaches, with significant improvements in model size reduction and processing time efficiency. Notably, this architecture outperforms most efficient time-domain models for the first time since 2019.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Spirituality, Religion, Lonergan, Secular, Conversion, Authenticity</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores authentic spirituality in the secular age by defining three key terms. It defines the secular age as one in which for the first time in human history, a purely self-sufficient humanism is possible. By using the work of philosopher Charles Taylor, it tells the story of the numerous developments and central anthropocentric shifts which had to occur in order for the secular to emerge. This thesis explores the development of the meaning of the term religion in the work of Wilfred Cantwell Smith, who argues that in modernity, a religion refers to a system of belief, by the generic religion refers to the sum total of these systems of belief. This thesis goes on to define spirituality as understood by romantic liberal modernity as a personal quest of self-actualization. The ten main tenets of romantic liberal modernity are outlined using the work of Galen Watts. An example of one such spirituality called wellness culture is explored through the work of Tara Isabella Burton. Finally, this thesis proposes an alternate definition of spirituality using the work of Keiji Nishitani and Bernard Lonergan, for whom spirituality is an orientation towards or relationship with reality. This definition of spirituality stresses the notion of authenticity, which for Bernard Lonergan is grounded in self-transcendence. Self-transcendence is achieved through intellectual conversion, moral conversion, and religious conversion.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Sidhu, Tanvir</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this research thesis, we address the intricate challenges presented by multi-item lot-sizing problems in production environments, considering stochastic demand, capacity constraints, and inventory limitations. Our objective is to formulate an optimized production schedule, drawing inspiration from existing literature models. We introduce two mathematical models for the lotsizing problem, incorporating aggregate service levels β and γ, and employ novel piece-wise linear approximations to address and extend existing formulations. Our research presents an iterative optimization-based solution approach for the piecewise linear approximation of the stochastic lotsizing problem. This process involves breaking down the overall planning horizon into smaller intervals, creating a more manageable planning horizon, and iteratively addressing a series of subproblems. Extensive computational experiments explore the implications of aggregate service levels, comparing the solution quality of the actual piecewise linear approximation model and the Fix-and-Optimize heuristic using four different interval lengths. Results highlight the nuanced relationship between interval lengths and computational efficiency, emphasizing the strategic importance of selecting intervals aligned with operational objectives. For instance, solving the piecewise linear approximation model for the β service level with a higher interval length (9) reduces computational time by 60% on average, with a corresponding average increase of 4.5% in the relative gap (cost). Similarly, for the γ service level, computational time decreases by 38% on average, with an average relative gap increase of 3.7%.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Synthesising New Pedagogies for Deep Learning with Transformative Learning Theory and the QEP for Meaningful Practices in the Secondary English Language Arts Cycle 2 Program</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Simon, Sarah</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis I critically examine New Pedagogies for Deep Learning (NPDL) to assess its compatibility with Transformative Learning Theory and Constructivism, one of the grounding theories of the Quebec Education Plan (QEP). This thesis explores how NPDL and the QEP’s Secondary English Language Arts Cycle 2 (SELA2) program can be brought together to create deeper, transformative, student-centred learning experiences for students in Québec. This thesis aims to establish common themes of the aforementioned theories and to propose a conceptual framework and outline some practical applications for SELA2 teachers in order to address critical 21st Century skills as well as subject-specific competency development outlined in the SELA2 program. Furthermore, this thesis addresses the complexity of educational change and asserts that the proximity of Secondary English Language Arts Cycle 2 teachers affords them with the profound power to affect change in instruction. It is my stance that providing students with more opportunities to engage in the development of 21st Century skills grounded in the principles of NPDL can open the door for transformation. The proposed framework and the use of applications such as those elaborated on in this thesis, educators can promote deep and more meaningful learning that can lay the groundwork for transformative learning experiences.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Access to information (ATI) policies and legislations emerged globally from the need to enhance democratic systems, by allowing citizens to monitor political decisions and contribute to social change. However, ATI does not always play out in reality as it’s spelled out on paper. Brazil is one of the many countries that suffers from flawed access to information laws, with not-so-transparent documents being an all-too-common experience for requesters. 
Fiquem Sabendo is an independent data agency that fights to hold the Brazilian ATI system to account. It is an organization committed to public transparency and, since 2019, has published 158 issues  of the newsletter “Don’t LAI to me”, which includes  “unpublished databases, news, tips and reports produced on or based on data obtained via ATI.” 
Through a detailed a thematic analysis of 147 issues of the newsletter, this research project sought to observe whether it fulfills the journalistic role of “the watchdog,” and what other theoretical roles of journalism are expressed in its content. The research also examines the tools the newsletter provides citizens to help others access public resources and information in an autonomous way. One research goal is to answer the question of how the newsletter mobilizes key concepts in access to information legislation, like “human rights,” “transparency,” and “objectivity.” Overall, the driving goal of this research is to increase awareness about the LAI in Brazil and to add to discussions in the field, highlighting barriers and opportunities for improvement in information dissemination through the lens of journalism.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Food loss is a major problem throughout the world and there are many reasons why food loss occurs. This research investigates the impact of country level factors on food loss across the harvest, storage, processing, and transportation stages of the global food supply chain. A thorough literature review was carried out to examine various research papers on factors causing food loss and the most pertinent country level factors were chosen for the study. Food loss and country level factors data was obtained for several countries and spanning several years, and multiple regression analysis was carried out. The findings of this research and similar studies in future can have a significant impact on devising policies and fuelling investments to improve food supply chain infrastructure for reducing food loss across the world.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Traditional Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) Meet Dynamic App-Device Interactions for IoT-specific Threat Intelligence</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Smolyakova, Sofya</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>While enjoying widespread popularity, IoT faces numerous threats with both traditional (e.g., Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)) and IoT-specific (e.g., device-application interactions) attack vectors. Therefore, gathering threat intelligence for an IoT environment is equally essential if not more (compared to many other IT environments). However, extracting threat intelligence from an IoT deployment poses several unique challenges. First, most IoT implementations are not logging threat-related information and even if they are, their logging mechanisms require significant additional effort to turn those logs to a threat intelligence. Second, there is no clear definition of IOCs (indicators of compromise), which are the key inputs to threat intelligence, in the context of IoT; including how to combine IoT-specific IOCs including that are involved with the dynamic app-device interactions. In this thesis, we propose IoTINT, a solution to obtain IoT-specific threat intelligence while addressing the above-mentioned challenges. Specifically, our key ideas are to first enable logging in IoT devices and apps without requiring any code instrumentation (in contrast to existing approaches), then iteratively finding dynamic interactions between IoT devices and their apps that are defined by automation rules and result in various security threats, and finally, combine both app-device interactions with traditional IOCs (such as, CVEs and CWEs) to build a comprehensive
threat intelligence for IoT. We implement IoTINT for Samsung SmartThings, a major smart home platform, and evaluate its performance (e.g., 100% coverage in extracting threat intelligence within 11 seconds for 10 realistic IoT attack scenarios).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Variable Intensity Patches With Swirls (VIPs): 
Novel Data Augmentation for Retinal Vessel Segmentation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sohi, Prateek Jeet Singh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Retinal vessel segmentation, deep learning,
data augmentation, variable patches, swirls, preprocessing.</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>A significant problem in retinal vessel segmentation (RVS) research is overfitting mainly due to the lack of large datasets. Data augmentation can alleviate this problem. Current augmentation techniques for RVS do not address the main challenges of localized variable intensities and microvessels in retinal images. This thesis proposes a data augmentation technique (termed variable-intensity patches with swirls, VIPs) to create augmented retinal images by randomly adding variable-size and variable-intensity square patches with swirl structures to a training image, online during training. We add patches and swirls without overlapping the retinal vessels. Our variable patches simulate images with illumination changes, and swirls add microvessel-like structures. To evaluate our augmentation technique, we study recent RVS models and examine the impact of their components, including augmentation, augmentation mode, and preprocessing. We then propose both data preprocessing (gamma correction and contrast enhancement) and VIPs augmentation to address challenges in RVS. Our experiments with in- and cross-datasets show that our combined augmentation and preprocessing technique significantly improves the performance of RVS baseline models (e.g., LWNet by 6.68% and SegRNet by 5.29% in AUC measure). Also, our technique is more stable than all related works across RVS models. Our approach helps to reduce the training-validation losses of RVS models and the gap between training and validation losses. We performed ablation studies on our technique: comparing patches versus swirls, looking at the impact of preprocessing, and analyzing its hyperparameters.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Impact of Inflation on the Cost of Capital: Evidence from the United States</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Solanki, Radhika</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper investigates the differential impact of expected vs unexpected inflation on the weighted
average cost of capital (WACC) of US firms. While both measures have positive and significant
impacts on WACC, economically meaningful effects are observed only for unexpected inflation.
When WACC is disaggregated into its components, similar findings are observed for the cost of
equity, but not for the cost of debt. During periods of high inflation, unexpected inflation does
have a significant effect on the cost of debt, and its effect on the cost of equity is augmented. In
contrast with some of the recent literature that does not consider inflation, we find a negative and
significant relationship between WACC and investment levels, which is in accordance with theory.
However, we do not find a significant relationship between the cost of capital and research and
development (R&amp;D) expenditures. This is consistent with the hypothesis that R&amp;D decisions are
based on internal financing sources.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effect of Gender and Funding on Research Performance</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Soleymanifar, Mohammad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In spite of various improvements and increasing involvement of female researchers in scientific 
activities in recent years, the gender gap still persists and women remain greatly 
underrepresented in technology, engineering, and computer science fields. This thesis attempts 
to shed some light on the effect of gender and funding on research output of Canadian 
researchers in natural sciences and engineering. In this research, using NSERC and Scopus
data from 1982 to 2018, we apply descriptive statistical analysis and regression analysis to 
study the influence of funding and gender on the quantity of published journal papers and their 
scientific impact. The study concludes that funding has a positive impact on both the number 
of papers published and the number of citations received by their respective author. However, 
we also observe that as career age of authors increases, researchers become less productive, 
they publish less papers and their citation counts slightly diminish with time as well, even 
though their funding amounts typically increase. In terms of gender, even though we find that 
female researchers are indeed greatly underrepresented and receive lower amounts of funding
than their male counterparts, they produce on average similar number of articles with similar 
scientific impact. This means that female researchers can generate comparable research output 
with lower research costs compared to male researchers and are thus more efficient in their 
research production. These findings suggest that governmental funding agencies should 
introduce more effective gender-related funding strategies and greater support for early-career 
researchers.</etd_ms:description>

An Act to Prevent and Fight Sexual Violence in Higher Education Institutions</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>In late 2017, Quebec passed Bill 151, An Act to prevent and fight sexual violence in higher education institutions, making it mandatory for universities and CEGEPs to adopt a sexual violence policy by January 1st, 2019. Conversely, student advocates expressed serious concern in relation to the lack of student consultation in the development and implementation of Bill 151. Currently, most research related to sexual violence in higher education focuses on university settings, offering minimal insight into the CEGEP sector. 

With the aim of consulting students, and of reducing the knowledge gap, this student-centered research evaluated the sexual violence prevention measures and support services at a public English-speaking CEGEP on the island of Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal. The anonymous online survey asked students about their awareness and opinions of the sexual violence support services and prevention measures available on campus and solicited their suggestions for improvements. 

The results showed that most students did not know how to access, nor had read their college’s sexual violence policy and procedures. Most respondents rated the prevention measures as ‘somewhat effective’ (48.2%), and the support services as ‘helpful’ (43.3%). However, students decidedly expressed the desire for a greater diversity of sexual violence prevention measures and support services on campus, as well as for more in-person interventions. The survey findings were further observed through the intersections of age, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity. The differences in averages between dominant and marginalized groups were also checked for statistical significance through the application of t-tests.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>“My Great-Grandfather Danced Ballet” is a poetic exploration of queer longing, queer mundanity, and contemporary cultural Judaism. The project has two primary components: (1) epistolary, persona, and narrative poems that tell the story of Ernest and Rubin, two homosexual Jewish lovers in pre-Holocaust Romania, and of Ernest’s later life in mid-twentieth-century Montreal; and (2) prose, lyric, and form poems that explore my homonormative existence in contemporary Montreal, including my relationship to my cultural Judaism, my romantic engagement(s), and my material comforts. These two components are connected by the fact that Ernest is a heavily fictionalized version of my actual maternal great-grandfather, Herbert, about whom I know very little save for the fact that he danced ballet in Romania before immigrating to Montreal. The two components intersect in metapoems that explore my queer longing: my desire to discover that my homosexuality, my queerness, is shared with a member of my family. The project is inspired by other contemporary texts, such as Casey Plett’s Little Fish and Lisa Richter’s Nautilus and Bone, that also seek to reposition familial or Jewish history in a queer context, and by media such as Bianca Stigter’s documentary Three Minutes: A Lengthening and Sebastian Meise’s drama Große Freiheit (Great Freedom), both of which explore mid-twentieth-century Judaism and/or queerness using new and innovative lenses.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Canada is touted to be a model of harmonious multiculturalism vis-a-vis other multicultural societies. However, implicit in Canadian multicultural policies are heteronormative and inequitable frameworks that shape the prevailing policies toward diasporic groups. Through discourse analysis and decolonial aesthetic observation, this study explores how Canadian multicultural discourse can be challenged through the art of Filipino-Canadian artists, and what the latter reveals about the experiences of Filipino immigrants in Canada. By performing a discourse analysis on the 1988 Canadian Multiculturalism Act and the 2017 Canada Council for the Arts Equity policy, in combination with the examination of the work of Toronto-based Filipino-Canadian artist Azia Jonelle, this study will seek to answer the following question: how does the work of Filipino-Canadian diasporic artists challenge normative ideas of Canadian multiculturalism? In the end, this paper will identify the predominant issues of Canadian multiculturalism by examining the artist’s particular representations vis-a-vis normative multicultural discourses found within the aforementioned policies, and thus determine how the particular experience of the Filipino-Canadian diasporic subject is disarticulated and rearticulated amidst Canada’s multicultural landscape.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Understanding how individuals interact with biotic and abiotic factors in their habitats, and how these interactions influence movement through landscapes is a key step in understanding dispersal events. The world is experiencing increased introduction of non-native species into new regions, however without an understanding of how species use the space they occupy, it is not possible to understand how dispersal events occur. We studied the short- and long-term movement patterns of a non-native butterfly species in Montreal, Canada: the European common blue butterfly, Polyommatus icarus, to determine whether the movement patterns of these butterflies over multiple days can be predicted by individual movement behaviours measured over short time periods. We asked what factors can predict short-term movements in females of this species, and whether these short-term movements can be used to predict long-term movements. We examined short-term movement by following individuals over short time periods and compared these movements to long-term movements observed via a mark-release-recapture study. In doing so, we found that flowering, host-plant species presence, increased vegetation height, and road edges can predict short-term movement, and that the short-term movement model produced can be used to accurately predict long-term movements when they are less than 100 m. These findings suggest that an understanding of ground cover characteristics is important in being able to predict the dispersal of most individuals, but that further work will be required to accurately predict long-distance dispersal events, which are what appear to be driving range expansion of P. icarus in North America.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Spina, Michael</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper explores the investment appetite for multi-family dwellings in the greater metropolitan areas of Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Toronto, and Montréal from 2015 to 2023. The study uses macroeconomic variables and a sentiment index built from Google Trends to analyze sale volumes of developers, individuals, institutional investors, and private corporations. The results of the study indicate that both developers and institutional investors are susceptible to the economic conditions and market sentiment when making decisions to securitize their investments. Conversely, individuals and private corporations respond inversely to periods of high or low volatility, with higher or lower transaction volumes, respectively, possibly with the strategic intent of purchasing properties at a discount. Additionally, the analysis reveals that increasing the money supply in Canada consistently correlates with increased investment volumes across all investor types. In contrast, periods of negative sentiment are consistently associated with lower investments.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Painting Punks and Pansies: Art as Affective Archive of Punk and Queer Subcultures in Postwar Kreuzberg</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Stewart, Caroline</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis will analyze neo-expressionist paintings made in Kreuzberg during the late 1970s and 1980s. The analysis will include Helmut Middendorf’s “Electric Night” (1979), "Großstadt Eingeborene" (1979), “Big City Natives” (1980), and “The Singer” (1981), Rainer Fetting’s “Van Gogh und Mauer V” (1978), “Grosse Dusche” (1980), “Figur an der Mauer” (1987), Salomé’s “Self-portrait” (1981), “Verschärftes Aufsteigen” (1981), “Nackt in Gelb” (1981), Luciano Castelli’s “Olé” (1981), and their joint work “Rote Liebe” (1979), as well as Bernd Zimmer’s “Brennende Fabrik III” (1981), and “Verwandlung” (1983). Ultimately, I seek to demonstrate that these works offer insight into the obscured subcultural communities of postwar Kreuzberg. 
My analysis of these artworks will draw on several methodologies, frameworks, and concepts. It will be heavily centered on affect theory, masculinity and queer theory, semiotics, fashion history, as well as the deep and complex entanglement of all of these notions. I will also draw from the anecdotal and oral histories provided to me by the artists themselves,  artistic experts, and other individuals involved in Berlin’s postwar artistic and subcultural scenes. Through these many avenues, I will unpack and analyze the aforementioned artworks in order to demonstrate how they present distinctive transgressive aesthetics that can be read as an affective archive of Kreuzberg’s punk and queer subcultures of the late 1970s and 1980s.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>We are living in the midst of a global climate crisis, where it is becoming increasingly important to learn how to live sustainably–meeting “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (United Nations, 1987, p. 16). This thesis explores what is involved in sustainable art-making today. By maintaining a visual journal of my experiences as an artist and environmentalist working with nature and communities over a three-month residency period (February to April 2024), and interviewing three female artists who produce art with natural materials or aimed at addressing environmental issues in their work, I developed a list of guiding questions and actions that artists can use to orient their practices to sustainability. The goal of this research is to provide a starting point for both emerging and established artists who deeply care about the planet to create art sustainably.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Working Madames in Canada’s Sin City: The Lives and Businesses of Montreal’s Brothel Owners and Workers in the 1930s and 1940s</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Stuart, Breeanna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Sex work has held an important yet marginalised space within Montreal society, with a pervasive culture of vice living alongside a selectively implemented legal framework. This thesis examines the lives and legal status of the women who owned and worked within brothels in Montreal during the 1930s and 1940s, as well as how brothels operated as small businesses. Women at all levels within the brothels, from sex workers to housekeepers to brothel owners, exercised agency in different ways. Many of Montreal’s brothels during this period were run as female small businesses that both interacted with and circumvented the police and municipal authorities. The main sources for this thesis are the depositions of twelve sex workers before Montreal’s 1954 Caron Inquiry, which provide an insider perspective on Montreal’s sex work industry in this period. These sources also shift the perspective from seeing sex workers as “existing” on the margins of society, criminalised and stigmatised for their methods of procuring a living and brings their work into Canadian workers history as a form of labour. Using a history from below approach, this thesis reads hostile state documents against their grain to piece together the lives of sex workers and to situate their stories within the context of the period’s legal framework surrounding sex work and cycles of relative toleration and repression. Through biographies of the women who were deposed before the Caron Inquiry, this thesis contextualises and humanises sex workers as workers and Montrealers with multi-faceted lives.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Oil spill accidents are significant environmental incidents that threaten environmental and ecological health. Among them, marine oil spills can cause severe damage to coastal residents and shoreline ecosystems. To enable effective response while minimizing additional environmental impacts, exploring and evaluating the potential use of low-toxicity chemicals for shoreline cleaning is crucial. This thesis begins with a comprehensive review of domestic and international literature, focusing on oil spill response techniques and the application of food-grade chemicals. Secondly, the study identified ovalbumin-based washing fluids as a promising option for shoreline oil removal. The effects of various environmental factors on the oil removal performance of ovalbumin washing fluids were examined. Different methods for the responsive separation of washing effluents were explored, and the separated precipitates demonstrated efficient decomposition using thermal and biodegradation methods. Thirdly, the oil removal performance of Accell Clean SWA under various low-temperature environmental conditions was assessed. Experimental results indicated that salinity and SWA concentration were the most significant factors influencing its effectiveness. Toxicity evaluations suggested that Accell Clean SWA is likely no more toxic than Corexit 9580 and PES-51, which have already been tested in real oil spill scenarios. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for developing potential green solutions for emergency responses to marine oil spills.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Parity Paradox: A Case Study on the Barriers Women Continue to Face Post-Parity</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sullivan, Mairin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In 2000, following decades of underrepresentation of women in politics, France implemented robust gender quota laws for National Assembly elections that required parties to nominate fifty percent men and fifty percent women. The laws were celebrated for guaranteeing gender parity in access to office. Despite increases in women’s representation with each election following the implementation of the parity law, the two most recent elections have shown no progress. Despite these quota laws in France, women’s representation in legislatures remains similar to other democracies. I seek to understand what barriers exist for women accessing political office, specifically in the National Assembly. I examine France’s unique historical legacy of the exclusion of women from politics and the importance of the concept of the universal citizen. I also delve into issues and gaps within the legislation itself. A lack of placement mandates and other factors can tempt parties to defect from following the law’s obligation. I also find that cultural factors, such as childcare obligations and depictions of women in the media, affect women’s equal access to political office. Using a combination of historical analysis, institutionalism, and a cultural lens, I conclude that the parity laws in France are not a sufficient condition for equality in access to National Assembly office. There are still significant barriers – both in the law itself, and from cultural and historical legacies - that affect women’s equal representation in French politics.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Security Questions in Web Authentication</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sun, Xin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>With the growing prevalence and sophistication of Internet services, user account security has become a critical concern. Security questions, widely adopted as a secondary authentication method, play a pivotal role in various online services. Although research on security questions has a long history, key gaps remain, particularly concerning user perceptions about security questions and the requirements used by websites for selecting and answering security questions. In this thesis, we address these gaps through a two-part study: (1) a comprehensive user survey (N = 292) that captures insights from a diverse and largely representative sample of the US population and (2) an analysis of an extensive set of 26 security requirements across 73 websites, also aiming to uncover security practices and weaknesses in their authentication systems (i.e., answer length restrictions). Additionally, we gather and analyze common online security questions (totaling 1913 questions) across several dimensions, including memorability, consistency, applicability, confidentiality, and specificity.

Our findings reveal previously unreported user misconceptions, such as users' believing that websites already possess correct answers to personal security questions. We also find that many websites allow insecure practices, such as accepting single-character, offering limited question choices, or identical answers for multiple security questions. By addressing both user perceptions and website security requirements, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the weaknesses in current security question practices and contribute to the discourse on improving authentication methods.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, the integration of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) into supply chain networks represents a transformative shift, promising to redefine the paradigms of logistics and transportation. This thesis delves into a comprehensive assessment of the impact of AVs on supply chain performance, with a particular focus on network design, operational efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Employing the advanced simulation capabilities of anyLogistix (ALX), the study constructs a digital twin of a conventional supply chain network, encompassing suppliers, production facilities, distribution centers, and customer endpoints. The research methodically integrates AVs into this intricate network, aiming to unravel the multifaceted effects on transportation logistics including transit times, cost-efficiency, and sustainability.
Through simulations and scenarios analysis, the study scrutinizes the operational resilience and adaptability of supply chains in the face of dynamic market conditions and disruptive technologies like AVs. Furthermore, the thesis undertakes carbon footprint analysis, quantifying the environmental benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of AVs in supply chain operations. The insights from this research are anticipated to offer a strategic framework for industry stakeholders, guiding the adoption of AVs to foster a more efficient, responsive, and sustainable supply chain ecosystem. The findings aim to serve as a cornerstone for future research and practical implementations in the realm of intelligent transportation and supply chain management.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Physicochemical Impact of Tocopherols on Lipid Membranes</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Taktikakis, Panagiota</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Lung surfactant is the lipid-protein monolayer at the interface between the air and the liquid lining the alveoli. It serves to ensure the lungs stay inflated during inhalation and to reduce the surface tension to prevent its collapse at the end of expiration. Exposure to e-cigarette additives vitamin E (a−tocopherol) and its acetate derivative vitamin E acetate (a−tocopherol acetate) through vaping has been linked to e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). This condition disrupts normal lung function, leading to severe respiratory distress that can cause hospitalization for difficulty in breathing, and, in some cases, lung collapse or death. Using a Langmuir balance, excess area calculations, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular studies such as grazing incidence X−ray diffraction (GIXD) and X−ray reflectivity (XR), the effects of these additives on the lung surfactant monolayer film have been examined and changes in surface activity, morphology, and molecular organization of the film assessed. The introduction of a−tocopherol and a−tocopherol acetate alters the fluidity, phase balance and modifies the composition of the different phases present. These changes could potentially impair normal lung surfactant function. This research also addresses potential short-term impacts on lung surfactant function due to vaping. In addition to its effects on lung surfactant, we studied a−tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E, for its interaction with common membrane lipids. Known as a potent membrane-soluble antioxidant, a−tocopherol plays an irreplicable role in preventing lipid peroxidation, which can otherwise lead to the degradation of cellular membranes, or even cell death. We used the same techniques to explore the mixing behaviour of a−tocopherol with both saturated and unsaturated membrane lipids. This revealed how a−tocopherol’s interactions vary based on the degree of lipid unsaturation, independent of the lipids headgroup.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Human Digital Twin (HDT) concept introduces an innovative framework for creating digital
counterparts of individuals, enabling real-time synchronization between the physical twin (PT) and
the virtual twin (VT). This PT-VT synchronization underpins various human-centered services but
demands significant data processing and efficient communication resource allocation, particularly
in resource-constrained environments. Semantic communication has emerged as a promising al-
ternative to traditional data-driven methods; however, single-encoder models struggle to meet the
diverse and dynamic requirements of HDT applications.
To address these challenges, this thesis presents a multi-encoder semantic communication frame-
work that adaptively allocates resources—such as bandwidth, computational power, and processing
frequency—based on application-specific needs. The short-term optimization problem is formulated
as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved using a genetic algorithm
(GA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-encoder model significantly improves
synchronization quality and power efficiency, outperforming traditional single-encoder models in
terms of accuracy, latency, and resource utilization.
To achieve a balance between immediate performance and long-term objectives (e.g., queue sta-
bility, sustainable energy usage, and high throughput), the thesis explores the long-term optimiza-
tion problem, formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved using Lyapunov-assisted
deep reinforcement learning. This adaptable and scalable approach positions the multi-encoder se-
mantic communication model as a highly efficient solution for future HDT applications.</etd_ms:description>

Multi-Camera Systems</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Traditionally, multi-camera calibration relies on physical objects and a controlled environment to achieve high-accuracy results, but this cannot be extended to real-time. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have enabled image-based camera calibration, offering real-time operation but
often sacrificing accuracy for speed. In this thesis, we address this trade-off by proposing a novel approach that leverages DL models for online and real-time multi-camera calibration with high precision. Current DL methods for camera calibration, while fast, often struggle with real images
captured in the wild due to varying conditions. Our approach tackles this challenge by introducing a deep learning model designed for online calibration scenarios from images with low inference time.
This model adapts to various camera poses efficiently, ensuring robust calibration across diverse viewpoints.
Central to our approach is the introduction of perturbations into the camera parameters, leveraging known initial parameters and 3D fiducial coordinates. This technique allows the model to learn and predict accurate camera parameters even in uncontrolled settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, particularly in scenarios requiring real-time calibration with high precision.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Accurate segmentation of brain ventricles from CT scans is crucial for clinical procedures such as ventriculostomy, which involves draining excess fluid from the ventricles to control intracranial pressure. Ventriculostomy is often performed in acute settings, making CT imaging the most commonly available modality. Unlike MRI, there is a lack of publicly available, well-annotated databases for developing CT-based brain segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, there is a need for intuitive confidence measures for segmentation results produced by automated algorithms, such as deep learning methods, which can potentially improve the confidence and accuracy of clinical tasks. To address these needs, we propose an end-to-end uncertainty-aware domain adaptation technique for CT ventricle segmentation. This technique is based on the joint training of translation models and anatomical segmentation, leveraging unpaired MRI and CT scans without segmentation ground truths. For the translation task, we experimented with three different generative models: Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN), Contrastive Learning for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) from GANs, and the Unpaired Neural Schrödinger Bridge (UNSB) from diffusion models, and compared their results. For the segmentation phase, we employed an attention-based residual recurrent U-Net architecture to compare with U-Net and ResNet. Also, considering CycleGAN's challenges with stability and structural consistency, we assessed various methods to understand their impact on translation and segmentation during our end-to-end training process. Additionally, we incorporated Monte Carlo dropouts in both MRI-to-CT translation and CT segmentation to provide an intuitive interpretation of the segmentation results.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>QUIC Protocol : Resilience against flooding attacks and
defense mechanism</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Teyssier, Benjamin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>QUIC is a modern transport layer internet protocol designed to be more efficient and secure than TCP. It has gained popularity quickly in recent years and has been adopted by a number of prominent tech companies. Its efficiency comes from its handshake design. The server and the client make both the transport layer acknowledgment and the TLS agreement during the same round trip. However this process makes the packets heavy and requires more processing on the server-side than TCP. This characteristic can be used as leverage by an attacker to compromise the computing resources of its victim.
This thesis investigates the resilience of QUIC Protocol against handshake flood attacks and proposes a detection mechanism (QUICShield). I conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the resource consumptions of both the attacker and the target during incomplete handshake attacks, including CPU, memory, and bandwidth. We compared the results against TCP Syn Cookies under Syn flood attacks. The DDoS amplification factor was measured and analyzed based on the results. This work also proposes a detection mechanism based on a Bloom filter combined with Generalized Likelihood Ratio Cumulative Sum (GLR-CUSUM) to adapt to evolving attack patterns. It was implemented and deployed against real attacks to evaluate its efficiency. We showed that the QUIC Protocol design has a much larger DDoS amplification factor compared to the TCP, which means QUIC is more vulnerable to handshake DDoS attacks. However the mechanism  proposed is accurate and efficient in terms of resources.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Enhancing Histopathology Image Generation with Diffusion Generative Models: A Comprehensive Study</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Thakkar, Denisha</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The field of histopathology faces significant challenges due to the limited availability of data, which is often not publicly accessible due to privacy issues. The scarcity of high-quality publicly available datasets hampers the development and training of effective deep learning models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have previously attempted to address these issues by creating synthetic data but suffer mode collapse, which reduces their effectiveness and reliability. This study explores Diffusion Generative Models (DGMs) as a unique and robust alternative for generating synthetic pathology images.
The primary objective of this study is to compare various Diffusion Generative Models (DGMs) and methods in medical imaging. Specifically, we examine the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), along with other generative sampling choices. Both models demonstrated the ability to generate realistic histopathological images. We also investigated DGMs from a unique perspective by generating various patch sizes, demonstrating that DGMs effectively learn patch resolution. 
We analyzed the impact of DGMs on different magnifications in the KGH dataset, focusing on image patches of 224x224 and 336x336 pixels. Larger patches (336x336) showed better performance, with real data achieving 94.06% accuracy and generated data 92.44%. However, combining real and generated data slightly reduced accuracy to 90.76%. For 224x224 patches, real data achieved 89.95%, generated data 88.62%, and combined data improved to 90.75%. These results indicate that synthetic data enhances model performance, particularly with larger image patches. 
In computational pathology, generative models can enhance data sharing and augmentation, improving the accuracy of deep learning classifiers, and assisting in the cancer diagnosis workflow, thereby advancing digital pathology. Our research findings confirm this and set the stage for future developments in the pathology workflow.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Cyber-attack, Risk Management, Data Breach</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Cyber-attacks are a global concern, escalating in frequency. Our study explores whether and how cyber-attacks affect the financial performance of the targeted firms. Unlike previous research, we examine not only attack incidence but also the financial consequences, considering attack and firm characteristics. In addition, our study is the first to explore whether the time frame over which an attack affects a targeted firm varies depending on the type of attack. While the former is reasonably well documented, the latter is not. Market responses are diverse and sometimes delayed, influenced by breach disclosure laws. Our study further examines whether market responses differ when the affected entity is a parent or a subsidiary.  Our results suggest that — because each cyber-attack has its own distinct characteristics — an aggregation of instances produces diminished or no results because markets respond within different time frames and in different directions. Our findings disentangle these effects and thus make an important contribution: contrary to the often insignificant findings presented by prior studies, we find that cyber-attacks have, on average, severe financial repercussions for the target firms. Parent firms appear more adept at handling these repercussions and may benefit from their size and diversification, allowing them to mitigate negative stock price effects, while subsidiary firms are hit harder.  Finally, we estimate the probability of a cybersecurity incident:  we report a convex relationship between a firm’s asset size and its susceptibility to (successful) cyber-attacks and a concave relationship between a firm’s net income and its cybersecurity risk.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The portrayal of the Jews in John’s gospel has been one of the most controversial subjects in biblical studies since the events of World War II, which prompted the church to seriously examine its texts and doctrines for their potential to contribute to anti-Semitism. The Fourth Gospel has been crucial in establishing essential Christian theology and its influence within the church and in broader Western Civilization should not be underestimated. The aim of this thesis is to analyze John’s anti-Jewish problem using a synergistic approach that blends historical and narrative-critical research to present a conclusion that respects the text’s genre and purpose. Scholars have rightly proposed that the gospel writers were presenting their unique views of Jesus using literary devices and larger narratives that sway their readers toward their perspective of who he was and why he died. Concurrently, the history of the Johannine community that lies behind the words of their gospel helps to support a narrative-critical reading and provides valuable insights into John’s harsh treatment of the Jews. The application of this methodology follows the author’s intended course of rhetorical argumentation and frames it within the context of an early Jewish-Christian conflict that sparked the anti-Jewish polemic that finds harsh expression in the gospel. The research put forward in this thesis finds that the Jews’ damning characterization and the author’s supersessionistic Christology cannot be limited to the gospel’s late first-century context, but have universal, long-term ramifications that ought to be addressed by the church.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this paper, I model a second price auction with an informed and an uninformed bidder and find the optimal information revealing strategy followed by the informed bidder at equilibrium. The informed bidder knows the state of the world with certainty, but the uninformed bidder does not know it. The informed buyer can commit to a strategy to reveal information to the uninformed buyer. The uninformed buyer then updates his belief about the state of the world based on the information revealed. I characterize the information revealing strategy that maximizes the expected payoff of the informed bidder. The strategy depends upon the state of the world, valuation of the informed bidder, and the distribution of valuations of the uninformed bidder for the object in the auction. The social planner's optimal decision would be to reveal complete information to remove the inefficiencies in the auction due to information asymmetry.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Transition to school; Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); Transition practices; Inclusive education; Special needs education</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>The transition to primary school is a significant milestone that introduces new demands and challenges for children, families, and teachers alike. Children with disabilities, including ASD, are particularly vulnerable, facing distinct and heightened challenges during this critical period. The present study aims to: (1) examine the implementation of recommended transition practices for children with ASD by general education teachers, assessing their perceived importance and primary concerns; (2) explore the experiences and perceptions of parents caring for children with ASD during the transition to school process; (3) investigate the interplay between teacher involvement in the transition process and parental concerns; and (4) identify the impact of parental competence on active involvement during the transition to school for children with ASD. Nine general education kindergarten teachers (n = 9) and four parents of children with ASD (n = 4) were recruited. A mixed methods approach (semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and scales) was used to address the research questions. Findings revealed significant concerns and barriers in the transition process, including the need for better communication, support services, and individualized transition practices. Despite high parental competence, disparities between teacher involvement and parental concerns underscore the urgency for improved collaboration. This research offers valuable insights for parents, educators, schools, and policymakers striving to enhance the educational outcomes and well-being of children with special needs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Toca, Sebastian-Gabriel</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This body of work aims to explain why a small island state would choose an advisory opinion at an international court as a strategy for pursuing environmental justice. Since this is not a common course of action in literature regarding small state advocacy, this choice stands out as an interesting departure which merits future studying. What was found throughout my research based on a constructivist and liberal framework is the fact that Vanuatu’s choice of strategy was heavily based on the current normative environment and the opportunity structures that emerged from negotiations. This is due to the fact that Vanuatu behaved both as a self-interested state weighing its options according to a cost-benefit analysis, as well a norm entrepreneur seeking to pursue the most legitimate route available. Through the use of process tracing delineating Vanuatu’s preference formation and decision making in regard to environmental justice, the choice of an advisory opinion at the International Court of Justice is made apparent by Vanuatu’s willingness to pursue the most legitimate avenue at its disposal. The key findings stemming from this analysis are then that a small state can act as more than its capacities indicate, and that it can do so by carefully weighing its choice of strategy and discourse. I would go as far as saying that this research highlights the strength of small states in international negotiations. More broadly, Vanuatu’s case showcases a positive outlook for small state advocacy and environmental justice no matter the verdict given by the ICJ.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Streamlining scheme theory with topoi</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tognetti, Francesco</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The aim of the script is to act as a course on Scheme theory from the internal perspective
 of the topos Sh(X), therefore showing that the internal logic of sheaf topoi is a strong
 enough foundation to build the whole theory on without necessarily referring back to the
 usual methods.
 In this thesis we define what it means to work from the internal perspective:
 We define elementary topoi and how to build and interpret formulas in the internal
 logic.
 After, we move to the specific case that is the category of sheaves on either a topological
 space or a locale, and explicit the semantics of that language.
 Weshow that the logic is intuitionistically solid and prove some results about geometric
 formulas that apply to later constructions.
 When that is done, we procede to rebuild some theory of schemes from this perspective:
 First we define abelian groups, rings, local rings and modules over sheaves, and some
 special cases.
 Then we build the basics of scheme theory by defining affine schemes, general schemes,
 coherent modules, and some special classes of morphism of schemes,
 In the end we attempt to talk about relative schemes from this perspective and what
 is needed to build the theory, then procede to show that it is well suited for a synthetic
 approach to schemes through some exercises from Hartshorne’s Algebraic Geometry

        <etd_ms:title>Vibrant Rock, Earth, and iPhone: Disrupting Extractivism in the Work of 
Marcela Armas and François Quévillon.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Trapara, Sara</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>As new extractive frontiers emerge in the Anthropocene, this thesis examines the way artworks by Mexican artist Marcela Armas and Canadian artist François Quévillon intervene in the capitalist paradigms, worldviews, and technologies that enable the extraction and exploitation of nature, mineral resources, and human labour. Tsinamekuta, 2016-2021, by Armas stands as a defence against mining practices on Indigenous land in Mexico, and revolves around a magnetic mineral called pyrrhotite and its radical potential to hold Earth memory. Esker/Lithium, 2019-2024, by Quévillon enters an iPhone into dialogue with a controversial prospecting lithium mine in Quebec, and considers the way novel forms of extraction emerge within digital, technological, and information-saturated environments. These artworks cultivate an ecology of practices that navigate assemblages of technologies, extractive zones, and environments across varied topographies of power. The theoretical foundation for this thesis draws from Elizabeth Povinelli’s concept of geontopower, Jason Moore’s inquiry into capitalism as an earth-moving and environment-making process, Vanessa Watt’s Place-Thought, and Franco “Bifo” Berardi and Jean Baudrillard’s ideas around semiocapitalism and simulacrum, amongst other authors. These thinkers investigate the climatic and social catastrophe of our epoch and challenge the ways in which dominant strategies of power dictate relations to nonhuman entities and to nature. This thesis thus explores what it means to be attentive to, become-with, and form alliances with different forms of existence through artistic practice, offering ways to move forward within the precarious and challenging times known as the Anthropocene.</etd_ms:description>

généré les thèmes suivants : conditions de vie en CHSLD ; importance de la durabilité d9une
initiative musicale collaborative ; musique classique en CHSLD et adaptation du répertoire ; étroite
collaboration avec les intervenants ; la force des musicothérapeutes ; utilisation d9Suvres du
répertoire classique. La deuxième catégorie, Avantages de collaborations, incluait les thèmes
suivants : bienfaits de la musique et de la musicothérapie ; accès à la vie culturelle en CHSLD ;
rôle du musicothérapeute dans une potentielle collaboration avec des musiciens ; bienfaits ressentis
par les parties impliquées ; la musique classique en CHSLD, des gains pour les aînés! Et la
troisième catégorie, Défis de collaborations, incluait ces thèmes : adaptation du répertoire musical ;
logistique ; plaider pour la musicothérapie; conditions de travail exigeantes pour les musiciens;
méconnaissance de la musicothérapie ; communication et logistique. Au chapitre de la discussion,
les résultats sont comparés, contrastés et organisés selon les impacts potentiels de collaborations
parmi les trois principales parties prenantes. Les limites de la recherche, les implications pour la
pratique, la formation, la recherche et la justice sociale sont présentées.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Magnetic Monopoles, as proposed by Dirac, can be used to resolve the quantisation of Electromagnetism, however the problem remains elusive to this day as no experimental evidence for their existence has yet been found. The scope of this thesis is to demonstrate a model of Milli-Magenetically Charged Dark Matter which mixes the visible Abelian Electromagnetic gauge field with the Dark sector. Our formalism involves a velocity- dependent coupling which relativistically depends upon the monopole mass, for which we evaluate the production cross section of proton-proton collisions. Our work focuses on the efforts to observe this particle as part of the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment at the LHC.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Idle Cinema: A Crisis of Knowledge in Narrative Film</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Urbanovitch, Malorie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Amplified by their use of long takes, slow films dwell on the minutiae of everyday life. Their time is drawn out, and their story-telling inefficient.  But as the term “slow” suggests, it has come to represent a manner of storytelling predicated on a delayed, but eventual arrival of an event – an event that ultimately meets the seasoned viewer’s expectation of a “pay off” and in retrospect, justifies the film’s slow build. Even still, the category has become synonymous with the idea that in these films, “nothing happens.” Slow cinema has thus devolved into an often pejorative label that accounts for any and every film that makes use of the long take and tests our patience. As this contentious discourse surrounding slow cinema has clouded a sufficient inquiry into its breadth of aesthetic approaches, the purpose of this thesis lies in identifying what I am calling “idle cinema,” a style of filmmaking that has grown out of the tradition of slowness, but takes its resistance to the narrative efficiency of classical narrative storytelling in new aesthetic directions. In idle cinema, ellipsis gains equal importance to the long take; like slow films, idle films make time visible, but they also make it disappear. As moving images are freed from the economy of  “adding up to something,” idle cinema becomes less of a resistance to speed than an expression of a crisis of knowledge.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Investigating the Minimum Discharge Required to Prevent the Winter Freezing of Water Supply Mains</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Usmani, Shadab</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Previous studies reveal a strong correlation between cold climates and water supply pipe damage, notably from pipe freezing in winter, which significantly affects millions of people in cold regions. Traditional measures like burying pipes or adding insulation are often ineffective and costly. The role of water flow dynamics in preventing winter freezing is often overlooked. Common advice to keep taps open in winter lacks precise flow rate guidance, causing water wastage. This study investigates the relationship between flow rate and air temperature to establish an optimal balance that prevents freezing while enhancing water supply system efficiency. Experiments used a 0.15-meter diameter Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipe in an environmental chamber set to freezing ambient (air) temperatures, with a continuous water flow maintained inside the pipes. Water temperature monitoring was conducted using probes placed strategically along the pipe. An analytical solution was derived to plot water temperature distribution due to negative temperatures at boundary. Numerical analysis was performed to simulate ice formation in 2-D (axis-symmetrical) geometry with varying boundary temperatures, which were then compared with experimental results. This study identified steady-state conditions between ambient temperature and water flow dynamics and instances of ice formation at specific flow rates and temperatures, leading to flow rate recommendations for different ambient temperatures to prevent winter freezing in water mains. The findings can help urban planners design resilient water supply infrastructure, enhancing sustainability and community resilience. By specifying optimal flow rates to prevent pipe freezing, this study supports sustainable water management.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A Comparison of 1D Beam-element and 3D Solid-element based Modelling
Approaches based on a Developed Tool for the Nonlinear Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Structural Components</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Uwitonze, Clement</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Nonlinear material models are needed for the capacity analysis of structural components. Often, 1D-beam element-based models are preferred over more sophisticated solid element-based modeling approaches due to their efficiency. However, their reliance on uniaxial material representations often overlooks the crucial influence of shear stresses, potentially leading to inaccuracies in predicting structural responses. In response, this study introduces a novel approach by integrating a multi-axial 3D concrete model within a 1D finite element framework, effectively capturing the effects of shear stresses. The proposed multi-axial elasto-plastic concrete model offers a comprehensive representation of concrete behavior under both tension and compression, thus enhancing the predictive capabilities of the analysis. By adopting a 1D beam-type finite element formulation, the research enables a detailed examination of shear wall behavior under lateral loading conditions. The main purpose of the thesis is to validate the developed finite element analysis tool which employs a sophisticated 3D concrete material model. The inelastic material behaviour of steel reinforcements bars has also been considered in the analysis. For the beam-type finite element, a 2-node formulation was adopted based on the Timoshenko theory so that the shear deformation effects are also considered in the analysis. For the modelling of the concrete bulk with 3D material model, the 8-node solid element with 6-degreesof-freedom per node including the nodal rotations was adopted. The numerical formulation is then used for pushover analysis of beams and shear walls and compared with experimental results from literature for validation purposes. Five different structural components are tested. Validation efforts include comparisons with experimental data from existing literature and alternative modelling approaches. Parametric studies are conducted by changing the span sizes of the structural components.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Coin Detection and Classification using a Few-Shot Learning method based on Siamese Network</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Vahed, Mahsa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Coins are used in our daily lives for a long time with less depreciation than paper currency. Detecting counterfeit coins visually is a challenging way with lots of errors. This thesis investigates advanced machine-learning techniques to differentiate between counterfeit and genuine coins with a small dataset. It focuses on the implementation of few-shot learning. This study is applied to two different types of datasets. The first dataset contains the images converted to grayscale, and the second dataset contains the four slopes images. As the detection of counterfeit coins is challenging due to their high similarity with genuine coins, more features are required before pre-training the neural network. 
For this study, 2,474 labeled images from the CENPARMI dataset belonging to 22 different classes were used. To enable experimentation, the dataset was split into two parts: a Main Dataset (Dm) and a Target Dataset (Dt). We used a pre-trained model, which learns from the Dm and adapted it to Dt. The Inception V3 network was fine-tuned in the main dataset to learn general coin characteristics. This knowledge was transferred to the target dataset to learn new coin types from a few images. FSL using Siamese networks and contrastive loss was used. The algorithm performance was evaluated using the total accuracy with different epochs and different batch sizes to earn the optimum of them, and also the precision and recall and F.score per class.
It is shown that the accuracy of our method in epoch 20 is optimal. At this point, the model achieves a high level of accuracy (92.13% for grayscale images and 94.73% for SMMIG images). the model trained with a batch size of 32 achieves the highest accuracy of 92.13% for the grayscale dataset and 94.73% for the SMMIG dataset, indicating that moderate batch sizes contribute to optimal performance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Effects of Aquatic Therapy versus Standard Care on Non-Specific Chronic Low Back Pain and Feasibility of mHealth Application Play the Pain: A Pilot Randomized-Controlled Trial</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Vaillancourt, Nicolas</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Introduction: The effects of aquatic exercise on psychological function associated with chronic LBP remains poorly understood and adherence to exercise-based interventions in CLBP is low. A promising solution to improve adherence is through the integration of mobile health application Play the Pain, which allows for continuous self-tracking of pain. 

Objectives: The primary objective of my thesis was to compare the effects of aquatic therapy to standard care on CLBP in terms of pain, disability, and psychological factors. The secondary objective was to determine the feasibility of using Play the Pain in a CLBP clinical intervention in terms of adherence and satisfaction. 

Methods: 34 participants with CLBP were randomized to the aquatic therapy (AT) group or the standard care (SC) group (AT, n=18; SC, n=16), while 12 participants tested Play the Pain. Outcome measures were pain (NPRS), disability (ODI), quality of life (SF-12), depression and anxiety (HADS), pain catastrophizing (PCS), kinesiophobia (TSK-11), insomnia (ISI) and adherence and satisfaction with the app. 

Results: Both groups significantly improved pain, disability, pain catastrophizing and quality of life with no differences between groups. Twelve participants used Play the Pain and 6 completed the exit survey. The adherence to the app was at 41.6% and the user satisfaction was low.  

Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of aquatic therapy to improve pain, disability and psychological outcomes associated with CLBP. We encountered many technical difficulties during the study that prevented our ability to adequately determine the feasibility of Play the Pain.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Evaluating Infrastructure Demand and Optimizing Charging Strategies for Battery Electric Bus Fleet - A Pilot Study on Concordia Shuttle Fleet.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Vakada, Murali Krishna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Battery electric bus, Discrete event simulation, Arena Software, Modeling</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>The transition from conventional buses to Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) poses significant challenges for transit agencies in terms of feasibility and in identifying potential operational issues. One of the crucial challenges is accurately determining the charging infrastructure demand for effective fleet management of electric buses. Insufficient infrastructure can result in operational problems, increased costs, and dissatisfied passengers. Additionally, high initial and maintenance costs, as well as compatibility issues, further impede infrastructure development. Evaluating infrastructure demand and the performance of different charging strategies in various route and operational conditions is essential in addressing these challenges. This thesis aims to evaluate the charging infrastructure demand and the effect of different charging strategies for a Battery Electric Bus (BEB) fleet using mathematical formulations and simulation modeling, specifically focusing on three scenarios: Depot charging, Depot &amp; Opportunity charging combined, and Opportunity charging. The impact of these scenarios on fleet operations is analyzed using Discrete Event Simulation, with Arena software employed for simulation purposes. Additionally, the thesis evaluates the daily average charging costs, considering appropriate assumptions. 

The results of the simulations indicate that both the Depot &amp; Opportunity charging combined and Opportunity charging alone scenarios outperform the depot charging strategy in achieving low charging costs. The analysis ascertained that a battery capacity of 300 kWh, coupled with a charging power of 100 kW, suffices to maintain a 100% trip success rate for the Concordia University shuttle fleet under the route conditions considered. However, it is worth noting that the depot charging strategy with overnight charging takes advantage of lower energy costs and grid loads during non-peak hours with proper charging schedules. Overall, the proposed work provides valuable insights for decision-makers and transit agencies looking to deploy electric shuttle bus fleets across different route conditions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Vasiliu, Iris Stefania</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study aims to analyze the impact of physical climate risks on the Canadian real estate market. Building upon the framework established by Duprey et al. (2021), we define and utilize a Multi-hazard Exposure Average Index (MHE) to measure the intensity and frequency of natural disaster exposure for each of the 1658 Forward Sortation Areas (FSA) in Canada. We examine the effects of the Average MHE on the operating and equity performance of Canadian Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Our findings reveal that REITs with properties facing heightened exposure to climate change physical risks report lower rental revenues and operating expenses. Additionally, our analysis indicates no significant relationship between the exposure of property portfolios to physical climate risks and abnormal stock returns, suggesting that the effects of climate risks are already integrated into market valuations. We further develop our study by exploring the interactions between the MHE Average Index and the main property types within REIT portfolios, where we observe statistically significant effects. This paper contributes to the understanding of how environmental factors are reshaping the financial dynamics of Canadian real estate investments, highlighting the importance of considering climate risks in investment decisions and property management.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Le présent mémoire a pour point de départ la traduction d’un livre de poésie intitulé A Pillow Book écrit par Suzanne Buffam (publié chez Anansi) et décrit le parcours d’une traductrice qui après de nombreuses années de pratique de la traduction pragmatique se lance le défi de la traduction littéraire. Une des particularités de A Pillow Book étant qu’il s’inspire d’une œuvre japonaise du Xe siècle, The Pillow Book, de Sei Shônagon (traduit du en anglais par Ivan Morris), la première posture explorée a été celle du pastiche. Cette posture ayant mené à un cul-de-sac traductionnel, elle a été abandonnée au profit de l’empathie rationnelle. Cette dernière a permis à la traductrice d’opérer un transfert de ses compétences en traduction pragmatique vers la « spécialisation littéraire ». Les aspects pratiques de ces transferts sont décrits par des exemples tirés de la traduction à proprement parler. La deuxième partie du mémoire est composée de la traduction du texte intégral de l’œuvre, intitulée, en français : Les Notes de chevet de Suzanne Buffam : Un livre sur les oreillers.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Velders, Cole</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines how brands utilize the marketing tactics of social media influencers to promote themselves in platform spaces in order to connect with their users. While contemporary netizens have become increasingly resistant to most forms of digital advertising (Ramadan 2017, Ariagada 2021), influencers have found success in promotional campaigns due in large part to their ability to appear authentic and demonstrate their relatability through the content they produce. Due to the success of these marketing strategies, several brands have altered their approaches to social media and incorporated aspects of influencership into their presentation in these spaces or attempted to become influencers themselves as a means of circumventing the ad resistance of their userbases. This thesis explores this phenomenon through examinations of two brand social media accounts that have found success through utilizing influencer marketing tactics: the Twitter profile of the fast food chain Wendy’s and the TikTok account of the language learning app Duolingo. By examining these brand accounts through the lens of existing research that defines the promotional strategies of influencers, this thesis highlights the aspects of influencership that both companies have incorporated into their respective approaches and illustrates the rationale behind these choices in digital presentation. Ultimately, this thesis seeks to expand the definition of influencership by demonstrating its potential as a tool of the market as its strategies continue to be co-opted by corporate entities and to encourage further academic scholarship that recognizes the steady progression of this phenomenon.</etd_ms:description>

Deindustrialization, top-down urban renewal, and shifting patterns of gentrification have impacted this neighbourhood in distinct ways, necessitating community-led solutions. Drawing on critical frameworks theorizing the entanglement of public art and processes of urban change, as well as community-authored historical sources specific to Pointe-Saint-Charles, this thesis aims to explore how actors within public art practices, such as artists, funders, and residents, negotiate a sense of place (Massey) within urban change. How can these different perspectives illuminate the sites and stakes surrounding public art in this neighbourhood? By exploring the conditions of commissioning, creation, and reception surrounding four public artworks installed or created over the last 50 years, this study reveals collective, personal, and political narratives of place, urban change and community spirit in a very unique neighbourhood in Canada. Informed by Elaine Speight’s concept of “place-listening,” this thesis proposes new methodologies that weave together the situated knowledge (Haraway) of long-term residents with archival research to resist dominant narratives of place, in favour of situated perspectives in Pointe-Saint-Charles.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>What if Ancient American civilizations developed into an advanced technological stage before European ones? What if these advanced civilizations then sailed across the ocean and discovered new lands ruled by monarchs and protected by knights? And what if they invaded these new-found lands to extract crucial resources for their survival, slaughtering anyone who stood in their way, including every single knight except one? 

Set in a fictional continent based on medieval Europe, fifteen years after the invasion of a modern Ancient-American-like nation, this novel follows Angmar, a seventeen-year-old hunter who’s obsessed with tales about knights and their adventures to slay monsters and save those in need—stories within the story based on classic medieval-fantasy epics such as Beowulf, Arthurian legends, and Tolkien’s novels. His father having died during the invasion, Angmar was adopted by Henry, an old hunter and war hero who takes care of the town’s orphans. Once Angmar learns that the outlaw known as the gun-breaker, who has the highest bounty ever recorded and is rumoured to be the last knight, was sighted near his town, he becomes determined to go after the terrible bounty.</etd_ms:description>

A Personal Exploration of Alternative Dining Experiences in Reaction to Industrialized Agricultural Practices</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>This research-creation approach to critical design finds itself at the intersection of agriculture, the built environment of the dining room, and queer philosophy. Adopting lenses from queer design theory to rethink domestic hierarchy, the work confronts consumer responsibilities, the importance of traditional crafting methods, industrialized agriculture, and intimacy surrounding food.

This research investigates the role tangible intermediaries—such as furnishings and instruments—play in the association of value onto ingredients we consume as sustenance, and onto community-based dining rituals. Through a critical point of view, the research investigates the possibilities of augmenting value in food through collaborative approaches of dining. Current food consumption habits are forcing agricultural practices to work in irreversible ways, against nature, to yield maximum results, without considering future implications, and so, this study asks: How can the proposal of alternative furnishings and tools shift consumers’ perception of food origin, value, and consumption rituals in domestic settings?

Stemming from this research is a series of homeware, dining instruments, and foraging tools that provoke reflection regarding our habits related to consumption of food, with the intention of creating additional value to its origin. Ultimately, this work aims at highlighting the value of community-based alternatives, for a more sustainable and more inclusive tomorrow. The research proposes an intimate reflection of consumption and access to sustenance through methods such as thinking through making and autoethnography.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>After-shows: Performance memories in (and out of) translation</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Vigeland, Anna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>What happens to live shows when they are over? After-shows started from a desire to collect intimate performance histories and re-present them, publicly: to examine what live performance events become, or might become, after they have formally ended, with particular attention to the personal histories associated with them. How to touch the absence of something that was once there and attempt to understand something about it, to inhabit a version of it, to interpret it, to make something else with those interpretations?

An interdisciplinary inquiry into methods and implications of researching, collecting, re-representing, reperforming, creating with, and (arguably) translating personal histories and memories connected to past live performances, After-shows encompasses: 1) oral history interviews with 16 performers and former performers, centered on memories of once-live shows; 2) performance research sessions with nine performers trained in different forms (circus, dance, music), experimenting with reinterpreting and creating off of fragments of  memories collected in phase 1; 3) an event re-presenting variations of those reperformed memories, open to the public; and 4) a series of post-event spectator interviews with eleven attendees of that evening, held between four and ten months after they attended, and focused on the ways they remembered the event.

Throughout these processes, this hermeneutically inclined research-(re)creation project examined how the question of untranslatability — or "the energy of the untranslatables" as per philologist Barbara Cassin  —  might be applied both as a dramaturgical motor and/or as a research lens in considering the re-representations of performance memories. 

Written both in and about the aftermath of a live performance event, this thesis echoes its on-site research-creation counterpart in considering untranslatability within representations of performance memories, drawing on oral history and research-creation methodologies, and looking across multiple interdisciplines including translation studies, memory studies, and performance historiography.

Receptor</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Vilkhu, Manpreet</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The human μ-opioid receptor (μOR) mediates the therapeutic and adverse effects of opioids, yet its structural determinants of function remain poorly understood. This study employed Scanning Site Saturation Mutagenesis (SSSM) to systematically analyze the role of 288 transmembrane core residues, generating a comprehensive library of 5,472 receptor variants. Using a yeast-based biosensor platform, we screened the library against the μOR agonist DAMGO to identify functional variants. Our results revealed critical insights into receptor-ligand interactions, including the identification of L178R, a variant exhibiting nearly double the signaling sensitivity of the wild-type receptor. This substitution, localized to intracellular loop 2, highlights the role of conserved residues in stabilizing receptor-G protein interactions. Additionally, we characterized non signaling variants to identify residues essential for receptor function. By integrating high-throughput sequencing and variant characterization, this platform provides a robust tool for probing receptor functionality and offers a foundation for refining opioid receptor-based drug discovery.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Education is essential for personal and societal development, yet balancing academic responsibilities and employment remains challenging for students. This thesis investigates the complexities of work-study balance among Canadian students, encompassing both domestic and international cohorts. Utilizing JD-R (Job Demands Resources) theory and transactional theory of stress and its extension ie the Challege-Hindrance Framework, the thesis examines how work demands like perceived work overload and study demands like minimum credit requirements influence perceived degree completion. A quantitative online survey gathered data from 108 participants across various academic disciplines and employment sectors, including domestic and international students. Findings reveal that while perceived work overload alone does not directly predict degree completion, its impact is mediated by work-study conflict. International student status, despite unique challenges like visa restrictions, does not significantly alter this mediated relationship. Practically, the thesis underscores the need for tailored support mechanisms and flexible policies in educational institutions to foster a supportive work-study environment. The study acknowledges limitations in sample size and design, suggesting that future research employs longitudinal and mixed methods approaches to further explore these dynamics across diverse academic and cultural contexts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The ‘Science’ of Sexism: Athletic Sex Classification and Fairness in Competitive Sport</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Walmsley, Mya</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper will examine how the justification and enforcement of sex classification in sport has been underpinned by a flexible, inconsistent account of sexual difference that I label ‘athletic sex’. My definition of athletic sex builds on the research of legal theorist Paisley Currah, who understands sex classification as an effect of state actors who classify people as a means to deny them resources. In an effort to expand Currah’s ‘functionalist’ analysis of sex classification beyond the activities of state actors, this paper will argue that athletic sex classification represents political concerns about the natural, biological, stable, and predictable properties of the sexed body in terms of their athletic capability in sporting institutions and regulations. I will explore in detail two functions of athletic sex classification. First, through a critical engagement with sports ethicist Sigmond Loland I will argue that the seemingly ethical value of fair competition substantiates the limits imposed by the idea of natural sexual difference when applied to sex classifications. I contend that athletic classification should instead be based on differing athletic capacities. I will further examine the progressive attempts by international sporting institutions to search for an objective scientific marker that would determine sexual difference and thereby preserve fair competition. Each marker has been based on features of the sexed body that proport to stand for natural feminine weakness, and has broadcast these differences through sporting institutions and popular entertainment in order to justify the restriction of resources for athletes in the female category.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effects of Ground Motions Characteristics and Higher Modes on the Seismic Response of Steel Strongback Braced Frame Buildings</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Wang, Shuaikang</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>To mitigate the weak-storey response that characterize traditional steel braced frames under seismic excitations, researchers proposed the Strongback Braced Frame (SBF) system, which is composed of a primary ductile system and an elastic vertical truss (strongback, SB). Although this system is not new, a comprehensive design method for sizing the SB truss members is lacking. It is worth mentioning that higher-mode forces are not limited by the yield mechanism of ductile system and they lead to large inertial effects relative to the first-mode response. Current studies conducted on SBF are limited for low-rise buildings where the strongback truss is integrated into the half side of ductile braced frame which leads to large ductile brace sizes. Hence, installing the SB truss exterior to the ductile system is beneficial.
In this research work, the SBF is derived from Moderately Ductile Concentrically Braced Frame (MD-CBF) with split-X braces and two SB configurations are considered: adjacent exterior and reversed exterior. 
The main objectives are: i) to simplify the design method for SBF to be appealing for practitioners, ii) to analyse the effects of ground motions characteristics and higher modes on the nonlinear seismic response of low-rise buildings braced by Strongback Braced Frame (SBF) with exterior SB, and iii) to discuss the seismic performance of SBF against that of traditional MD-CBF.
The case study is a 4-storey SBF office building located on Site Class C in Victoria, B.C. Two sets of ground motions were considered in analysis: the short-duration crustal ground motions, and  long-duration subduction ground motions characterised by Trifunac duration &gt; 60 s. Detailed numerical models were developed in OpenSees  and the nonlinear seismic responses of buildings were expressed in terms of interstorey drift (ISD), residual interstorey drift (RISD), floor acceleration (FA) and storey shear. To identify the types of failure mechanism, the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was employed and the IDA curves were developed considering both sets of ground motions. The collapse margin safety was assessed and the performance of SBF building was compared against that of the benchmark 4-storey MD-CBF building. 
The SBF system is found effective in mitigating the weak-storey response, distributes ISDs uniformly along the building height, exhibits reduced residual drift, and provides about 50% larger safety margin compared to traditional MD-CBF systems. In addition, the SB truss is able to respond in the elastic range while engaging all ductile braces to dissipate the input energy. Although one or even two ductile braces experienced fracture caused by low-cycle fatigue, the SB is able to prevent the occurrence of dynamic instability. Moreover, the subduction zone records that are reach in high frequency content, excite the higher modes and in consequence amplify the upper floors responses. Thus, the type of failure mechanism of SBF is strongly influenced by the mean period of ground motions; hence, the records with short mean period trigger amplified demand at upper floors, while those with longer mean period trigger damage at lower floors. It was also found that the SBF buildings show sufficient collapse margin safety and the SB location slightly influences the seismic response of SBF. However, the 4-storey MD-CBF building showed a borderline pass of margin safety criteria and is not recommended in subduction zone prone regions. 
Future research is required to investigate the higher modes effect on building height, as well as the impact of differed types of ductile braces on the global response of steel SBF buildings.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Mencius on Xin and Xing</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Wang, Zechen</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>‘Human nature’ is a widely discussed ethical concept in both philosophical traditions in the West and the East. In ancient China, Mencius, one of the most influential philosophers, claimed that human nature is good. However, he did not appeal to logic when presenting his argument, instead he provides seemingly anecdotal evidence to his claims. How can we provide a plausible interpretation for Mencius’ claim? One problem arises as one assess his arguments. Mencius held the belief that human nature, attributed to tian (‘Heaven’ or ‘Sky’), lies beyond human influence. However, he also contended that human nature embodies a normative aspect and is inherently virtuous. This raises the question of how Mencius reconciles the innate and normative aspects of human nature. 
In my paper, I argue that xin, a concept introduced by Mencius, plays a vital role to understand his argument of human nature is virtuous. In Chinese philosophy, xin, though literally means heart, serves the dual functions of feeling and thinking. According to Mencius, the xin is where moral tendencies are rooted, and our moral actions are motivated. I argue that the very concept of xin, is fundamental for Mencius to reconcile the innate and normative aspects of human nature. It is also key for helping us to understand Mencius’ argument that human nature is good.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Forecasting Electricity Load and Wind Generation: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models Enhanced by Bayesian Optimization under Different Sampling</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Wang, Zhen</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The study explores the application of advanced machine learning techniques to forecast electricity load and wind generation data, focusing on the optimization and comparative analysis of various models. Given the critical importance of accurate energy forecasting in managing power grids and integrating renewable energy sources, this research seeks to enhance forecasting precision through the application of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning across multiple models. Utilizing time-series data, this study systematically evaluates the performance of several predictive models. Each model's parameters were meticulously optimized using Bayesian techniques to identify the most effective configurations for handling the complex dynamics of energy data. The research methodology involved a comparison within single datasets to identify the best model. Subsequently, the best-performing models were further analyzed across different datasets to validate their robustness and generalizability. The primary evaluation metric is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), complemented by additional metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of model accuracy and effectiveness. Key findings demonstrate that while some models excel in capturing overall trends, challenges remain in addressing the volatility and variability inherent in the data. The insights derived from this study not only advance the field of energy forecasting but also offer practical implications for energy policymakers and stakeholders in optimizing grid performance and renewable energy integration.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Root Medicine: 
Confronting Indigenous Segregation and Building Partnership in Qu’Appelle Healthcare, 1870-1950</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Warren, Brittany Lisette</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In recent decades, oral history and storywork have transformed the study of Indigenous health histories. Through a desire-based research framework, this study aims to foreground the many ways by which First Nations reserve communities have continuously asserted self-determination through practices of holistic, land-based wellness in Treaty Four territory. The two-part study begins in the context of the All Nations Healing Hospital in Fort Qu’Appelle, Saskatchewan. With a blended approach of clinical Western medicine and a robust offering of traditional Indigenous therapeutics, the hospital reflects the diverse cultural protocols of the Nêhiyawak /ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐤ (Plains Cree), Anihšināpē/Anishinaabe (Saulteaux), Nakoda/Assiniboine, Lakota, and Dakota. Through the voices of three co-researchers, narratives of hope and empowerment are emphasized with on-the-ground examples of healing. Building from these rooted understandings of Indigenous wellness, the study then explores the development of segregated healthcare and biomedicine in the settlement period, 1870-1950. The fight against tuberculosis in the Qu’Appelle region was headed by Doctor R. G. Ferguson, whose activities in the Fort San Sanitorium and Fort Qu’Appelle Indian Hospital reveal ideologies which prevented, and may still prevent, Indigenous-led healthcare collaboration. While Western attitudes of civilization and medical progress have asserted decidedly linear histories, Indigenous perspectives on health present a cyclical and highly adaptive knowledge base. In this way, the present success of the All Nations Healing Hospital is not simply a departure from oppressive medical systems of the past, but an ongoing reflection of cultural continuity and embodied governance in health and healing.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Virtual reality is no longer a dream, the future is here. Virtual Reality (VR) offers endless potential for individualized rehabilitation for patients and previous research has established use- cases for multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, burn victims and stroke patients. With respect to sports, VR studies have primarily been focused on training skills or rehabilitation for injured soccer athletes. There is a lack of research on VR’s use as a rehabilitation tool for ball sport athletes. This study aimed to investigate whether health care professionals could use VR for injury rehabilitation as a pain management, immersion and flow tool on these athletes. We conducted a within-subjects design to investigate the effectiveness of VR as a distractor from chemically induced pain by Capsaicin, mimicking real injuries, using a sample of Canadian baseball athletes. Our research questions focused on investigating to what extent being immersed in a sport-specific activity had on how much flow and immersion was experienced, thereby reducing pain even greater than a non-sport specific activity. We randomized the order of three tasks, a non-baseball computer condition (Two-Back), an easy VR baseball practice condition and a challenging hard VR baseball game condition. While the results showed a decrease in pain, they were not statistically or clinically significant. However, our results did show that VR conditions produced a statistically significantly higher and comparable level of immersion and flow for both difficulties, when compared to the Two-Back task. For clinicians who want to immerse an athlete in their sport outside of the field of play, this research shows that Virtual Reality is a valid option.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>For this thesis, I have written a series of interconnected short stories that tell the early life of Teklė, a Lithuanian immigrant to Canada in the 1930s. These stories are written alternately from Teklė’s point of view as well as that of different women who come in and out of her life. In this work, I aim to paint a picture of the ways women recognize and connect with one another through common experiences, in turn telling the story of Teklė’s hardships, unwavering hope, and determination to find family and place. Teklė is based loosely on my own grandmother, and each story in the collection centres around people and events that influenced her life.

In the women’s stories, I explore themes of grief, caretaking, marital conflict, child-rearing, and other responsibilities carried by women across generations. Each woman is compelled by Teklė’s presence to reflect on their own life, and in turn help Teklė to heal and move on. 

Interspersed are stories told from Teklė’s point of view, providing an opportunity to see her unfiltered at pivotal moments. Although the themes of abuse, scarcity, discrimination, and sexism run through the collection, Teklė remains a character with unshakable hope. Hers is ultimately the story of the female immigrant experience, where new lives are built on a foundation of trauma and tragedy that’s often walled away for survival. This collection is an attempt to remove some of the bricks for Teklė.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This study conducts an in-depth analysis of the short-term variable transportation and warehousing costs at the Horace Plant (HP). The primary goal is to develop cost-saving strategies that enhance operational efficiency while reducing overall costs. The analysis focuses on three main cost components: trucking costs, pallet movement costs, and warehousing costs, which are incurred during shipments between suppliers, warehouses, and production facilities, as well as the movement and storage of raw materials and components in a short horizon. The study employs Linear Programming (LP) techniques, specifically a Multistage Multi-echelon Multiproduct Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, to capture the complexity of Cosmetics Company's supply chain network. The model, including multiple products, suppliers, warehouses, production warehouses, and periods, offers a robust framework for optimization, instilling confidence and reassurance about its effectiveness in supply chain management. Results from the model reveal cost-saving opportunities and operational improvements. Sensitivity analysis provides insights into key cost drivers and potential areas for cost reduction. The practical application of this study lies in its ability to offer real-time, actionable insights for daily supply chain operations, which is crucial for handling demand fluctuations and ensuring cost efficiency in the beauty industry. The study enhances visibility into goods flow and potential short-term shortages by providing deeper managerial insights into the optimal routing and storage of pallets. This supports strategic and tactical planning, driving continuous improvement in supply chain performance and instilling a sense of optimism about the future of supply chain management. Ultimately, the study demonstrates the practical benefits of advanced optimization models in complex, dynamic environments, contributing valuable insights to the field of supply chain management.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper looks at how the installation of sewers, food hygiene regulations, and trash reform affected mortality from infectious diseases in Brooklyn and Manhattan from 1867 to 1927 combining data from Historical Urban Ecological dataset, the census and Brooklyn and New York Departments of Health. A linear regression with fixed effects is used to investigate which diseases these policy decisions impacted the most. The results will show that milk sanitation, a food hygiene regulation, had the greatest effect on reducing infectious diseases. Installing sewers had a beneficial effect on Manhattan, but Brooklyn saw an increase in infectious diseases as sewage from Manhattan was dumped upstream of Brooklyn. Similarly, trash reform in Manhattan worsened the health of people living in Brooklyn because trash from Manhattan was burned in Brooklyn. These results may guide policy-makers in developing countries to prioritize food safety regulations as well as sanitation of waste over relocation to minimize negative externalities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In fisheries management, reliable estimates of population abundance metrics such as standing biomass are crucial for sustainability and balanced decision-making. The OGive MAPping (OGMAP) method, used by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in Newfoundland and Labrador for biomass estimation, addresses non-normally distributed populations but raises concerns about handling spatial data variations. I conducted a simulation-based comparative analysis comparing OGMAP against Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and STRAtified Programs (STRAP) to answer the following question: “are the uncertainties of the estimates calculated from these different methods reliable?”
Using Northern Shrimp, Pandalus borealis, as a reference, I simulated biomass landscapes, exploring parameters like landscape roughness, sampling intensity, and model settings. The analysis consistently showed OGMAP's failure to capture nominal confidence intervals (CIs) compared to alternatives, regardless of the treatment. OGMAP exhibited tighter intervals, raising concerns about overfitting and its inability to reflect the true landscape biomass. However, halving the automatically optimized bandwidths for OGMAP's probability distribution fields significantly improved its realized coverage.
These findings underscore OGMAP's variability, shedding light on its limitations in decision-making by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. I stress the pivotal role of reliable estimates in fisheries management. Additionally, I suggest that alternative methods, like GAMs, may offer more dependable forecasts given OGMAP's underperformance. This research prompts a review of the fisheries management framework relying on OGMAP, suggesting potential inadequacies in capturing the true uncertainty associated with spatially distributed stocks.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Characterization of Monomer GAPDH
S-Loop Motion and NAD+ Binding
using Molecular Dynamics Simulations</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Wosu, Robert Ojike</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a highly abundant enzyme in cells, performing numerous functions in various oligomeric forms.  The stable cytoplasmic homo-tetramer plays the primary (glycolytic) role.  Here, the focus is the unstable, nuclear monomer (subunit), implicated in DNA replication, repair, and packing into chromosomes.  Insight into enzyme function, via temporal sampling of conformational changes and transitions 
between binding states, is difficult to achieve using experiment.  Functional loop (S-Loop) motion and cofactor (NAD+) unbinding of the Human Placental subunit structure (PDB Entry 1U8F) were studied using classical, all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.  Conformational trajectories, generated using conventional MD simulations, revealed that S-Loop motion consists of pivoting (mainly) and internal deformation, and that this motion becomes more concerted (increased magnitude and directionality) when NAD+ is bound to the subunit.  Ligand unbinding trajectories, generated using steered and umbrella sampling MD simulations, revealed that NAD+ unbinding is unfavourable, but still feasible if the adenine ribose is pulled away from the subunit while its S-Loop is pivoted away from the NAD+ domain, and entails among other things, Asp-35 unbinding, as well as Lys-194 binding and subsequent unbinding.  The present work reinforces the vital role of bound NAD+ in bringing order to subunit S-Loop motion, which in turn is essential for maintaining inter-subunit interactions in the GAPDH tetramer.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides an unprecedented ability to investigate brain health and function. However, the high cost and high variability in the population limits its use in understanding complex diseases, which requires new methodologies. As such, the focus of this project was to define and identify a novel reorganisation of long Covid brain MRI data into network graphs and subgraphs based on functional, rather than spatial, connections between voxels. We define a physiological connectome: a graph in which the nodes are voxels, MRI metrics are node attributes, and edges are formed according to physiological similarity. From these graphs we define local neighborhood subgraphs containing each voxel’s set of nearest neighbours, which we examine for their properties. MRI features most strongly associated with high connectivity included low values of axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF); and mean values of intracellular volume fraction (ICVF). Orientation dispersion index (ODI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were highly variable. The general data trends outside of highly connected voxels include an inverse relationship between FA and ODI, RD and FA, AD and ODI, ICVF and RD, and ICVF and MD; a positive correlation between AD and MD, ODI and RD, and RD and MD. RD and AD, and ISOVF and ICVF do not demonstrate a clear trend. In future, these subgraphs will form the basis for a generalisable data augmentation and analysis method, to identify underlying patterns responsible for large-scale functional differences between brains.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>ConfSys, a conference management system, has been used for over 15 years to manage a number of international academic conferences, such as C3S2E, IDEAS, and ICCM.  It supports multi-event, multi-track conferences with a large number of user participation and submissions. It provides essential services such as setting up a conference, user sign-ups, call for papers, paper submissions, paper auction, paper allocation and review, blind debate, paper decision, author registration, final version submissions, automatic session management, presentation uploads, program generation, managing event sessions and electronic proceedings creation to efficiently manage and support the running of academic conferences and journals.

This thesis presents the fourth iteration in the ConfSys system to further accelerate enhancements and to incorporate new features keeping in sync with recent technological advancements. It presents new approach for Automatic Semantic Header Generation (ASHG 2) in Information Retrieval from academic documents such as research papers. ConfSys4 includes modules for document processing, information retrieval, and document classification. Document processing involves conversion of PDF documents to XML-formatted documents. Information retrieval involves extraction of paper-related details such as title, abstract, keywords, author names, emails, organizations, locations, affiliations, and author references present within the document. The extraction of author-related details ensures verification of the author metadata and references section for the submitted document. Document classification involves extraction of important subject headings (keywords) based on the contents of the submitted document. Thus, improving the paper submission, single/double/triple-blind review, and paper allocation process by reducing manual data entry by users. Additionally, ConfSys4 includes improvements to existing features, such as adding automatic reminder emails to program committee members for updating their topics of interest for improved paper allocation and using entity matching technique for author pairs identification with conflicting interests. Furthermore, the PayPal payment interface is improved to include a standard checkout feature for payments and PDF document generation for the final program, invoice, and payment receipt for user registration to events. These improvements in ConfSys4 ensure consistent metadata generation for papers, improved transparency, ease of usability, and operability for organizing committee members, authors, and system users of the ConfSys system.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis presents the development of the Chlorophyll-a Modeling and Monitoring Online System (CMMOS), an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tool designed to enhance the monitoring and prediction of chlorophyll-a concentrations in lake ecosystems. Traditional methods of monitoring these concentrations face limitations in real-time data processing and the handling of complex environmental interactions. CMMOS addresses these challenges by integrating a sophisticated array of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Tree (GBDT), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The system's efficacy was rigorously evaluated using comprehensive datasets from Lake Champlain and Lake Simcoe. Through these evaluations, the system demonstrated high predictive performance, particularly for models like RF, GBDT, and XGBoost, which excelled across various metrics. Data preprocessing techniques including Missing Value Imputation, Outlier Detection, and Feature Selection proved critical in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of these models. CMMOS contributes to the field of environmental science by offering a real-time, data-driven approach to lake water quality management. The system facilitates dynamic monitoring and predictive analysis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions promptly. It illustrates the substantial advantages of utilizing AI in ecological monitoring and management. Recommendations for future work include further optimization of machine learning models, exploration of ensemble techniques to refine predictive accuracy, expansion of the system to include more diverse environmental variables, and enhancements to the user interface to better serve various users. This thesis lays a robust foundation for future advancements in AI applications for environmental monitoring, aiming to improve the sustainability and effectiveness of lake management practices.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>TASKS, Persona, Human Behavior, Mental Stress</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis addresses the complexities of task implementation, focusing on personalized barriers encountered in diverse contexts. It introduces the TASKS framework as a novel deductive approach to analyze and overcome these barriers. The framework, grounded in the interplay between tasks and an implementer’s Affect, Skills, Knowledge, and Stress, offers a structured method to identify and address personalized implementation barriers. The thesis validates the framework through three distinct case studies: enhancing designer creativity in design processes, identifying personalized barriers in hypertension self-management, and understanding stakeholder behavior in sustainable product design. Each case study illuminates the framework’s efficacy in different scenarios – from creative design practices, healthcare challenges, to environmental sustainability in product design. The findings demonstrate the framework's versatility in categorizing barriers into emotional, logical, knowledge, and resource categories, and its effectiveness in providing tailored solutions. This research contributes to implementation science by offering a comprehensive tool for understanding and tackling personalized barriers in various task implementations, emphasizing the importance of customizing strategies to individual needs and contexts. The thesis not only enriches our understanding of task implementation but also sets the stage for future research directions, including developing tools for streamlined barrier analysis, exploring dynamic problem-solving methods, and team design and healthcare systems, aiming to enhance the practical applicability and scalability of the TASKS framework.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Effects of sound masking noise on workers’ perception and performance</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Yang, Qingyang</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>There is always a lack of separation between individual work areas in open offices, so sound insulation is poor. A cheap and effective solution to this problem may be to use sound masking technology. This study aims to explore the impact of sound masking noise on employee perception and psychology in scenarios involving two types of signal speech noise involving sound masking technology. Specifically, this study implemented background noise, speech, visual stimuli, and interactive components required in a real-time virtual reality framework. Ten participants participated in a multi-task cognitive experiment. The key metrics for evaluation include task completion rate, accuracy, NASA Task Load Index, and individual noise sensitivity scores.
The average accuracy is lower in the 50 dBA with speech condition compared to the 38 dBA with speech condition. Similarly, participants complete fewer math questions on average in the 50 dBA with speech condition compared to the 38 dBA with speech condition. The combination of higher noise levels and speech (bad signal-to-noise ratio for speech) significantly hampers task efficiency. It shows that the ten participants have different levels of sensitivity to noise or speech. People with higher noise sensitivity will experience the highest task load in noisy environments with speech. In environments with irregular noise patterns, sound masking systems may inadvertently amplify rather than mask irregular noise. This study not only observed individual differences in noise sensitivity and cognitive effects, but also highlighted the importance of individual responses to noise in managing noise exposure in the open plan offices.

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring the Impact of Board Laziness on CEO Succession</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Yeganeh Boroojeni, Sadra</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research analyzes and introduces "board laziness"—a term that describes the level of involvement of a company's board of directors—and its influence on selecting the next Chief Executive Officer (CEO), using 1100 succession events among S&amp;P 1500 firms. Our hypothesis suggests that lazy boards are more likely to appoint an insider CEO than an outsider due to a lower engagement in the hiring process. We ran regressions on proxies separately to understand their connections to our dependent variable and also created the Index using ten laziness proxies. We controlled the size, performance, and industry of the firms. Whereas different tests showed a significant and reliable connection between both proxies, index, and the model, results showed a significant negative relationship between board laziness and the likelihood of hiring an insider CEO, indicating that lazier boards tend to favor outsider CEOs. This finding suggests that lazy boards might prefer outsider CEOs to initiate changes and improvements within the organization. Additionally, our research investigates another layer of corporate governance by examining the potential negative impacts of board laziness on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. Both studies highlight the significant correlations between board laziness proxies, firm size, and performance. This study aims to enhance the existing corporate governance literature and provide valuable insights into how a board's involvement can impact hiring decisions and offer fresh views on leadership succession. It also opens windows for future research to explore the effects of external shocks, such as financial crises or scandals, on hiring decisions and to consider additional qualitative factors influencing board behavior and decision-making processes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Workforce planning for SMEs under stochastic labour turnover</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Yeung, Ho Kei Andrey</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In today's rapidly changing manufacturing industry, even minor uncertainties can cause significant disruptions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Although previous studies on operational supply chain networks have focused primarily on addressing uncertainties related to demand fluctuations, machine breakdowns, and unpredictable events such as natural disasters and geopolitical disruptions, this paper specifically addresses workforce uncertainty due to stochastic turnover rates. As an extension of the multistage workforce capacity planning problem with turnover proposed by \cite{2007Successive}, this study builds on their workforce planning network, which incorporates decisions around transferring, hiring, and firing, by introducing a proficiency ranking system. This system classifies the workforce into three proficiency levels, each with a specific production rate according to the worker's status. Integrating this proficiency ranking system into the planning network allows a more comprehensive evaluation of workforce capabilities to meet the required demand. Results from numerical experiments demonstrate that the modified model offers an optimized workforce planning solution, balancing cost and time effectively, to help SMEs achieve their demand targets under conditions of uncertain workforce turnover.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Yimbila, Shadrack</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Throughout history, the energy crisis has predominantly arisen from inadequate supply rather than depletion of resources. From the utilization of fire to the development of steam engines and, subsequently, the utilization of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources, humanity has consistently adapted to meet its energy needs. Particularly noteworthy, hydrogen stands as a significant and renewable energy source. However, the demand for hydrogen has tripled since 1975, and due to technological limitations and high costs, most of its production still depends on fossil fuels. Various approaches have been employed to address this issue, one of which is photocatalysis, which holds promise in mitigating the adverse effects of fossil fuel production. Nevertheless, this method has limitations regarding light absorption and the recombination of charged particles. Zero and one-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanotubes, have been extensively investigated as potential photocatalysts, as they exhibit unique properties, including a high aspect ratio that facilitates the controlled movement of charges in a single direction. In order to overcome the aforementioned limitations, modifications have been made to these nanostructures.
However, conventional methods employed for these modifications have drawbacks, such as the extensive use of toxic solvents, limited control over the process, time constraints, and lack of reproducibility. In contrast, greener synthesis methods, such as microwave deposition and liquid-assisted resonant acoustic mixing (LA-RAM), have emerged as viable alternatives due to their minimal energy input and reduced reliance on toxic solvents. Moreover, microwave deposition and liquid-assisted resonant acoustic mixing offer advantages such as shorter reaction times, controlled and uniform deposition, scalability, and improved reproducibility, which address the challenges faced by conventional methods. In this study, transitional metals, namely copper and nickel, were decorated onto titania nanoparticles using LA-RAM and titanium nanotubes using microwave deposition. The individual and combined effects of copper and nickel decoration were investigated alongside optimizing some reaction parameters. Compared to conventional noble metal decoration and traditional synthesis, the photocatalytic efficiency of the resulting best outcome proved to be a practical and effective option. This research lays a foundation for further exploration and utilization of greener and more cost-effective methods and metals in synthesizing photocatalysts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Yuskovitz, Jayson</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The present study investigates and characterizes potential relationships between accentedness and three language attitude traits: friendliness, intelligence, and employability, in a comparison of L1 English and L1 non-English individuals. Using a direct approach method and situated in the broader English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) context, this research is intended to provide insights for the second language speaker of English regarding the perception of their accented speech. Insights into such perceptions are of high concern to the second language speaker, whose accented speech output is inherently linked with positive or negative judgments by listeners. These judgments are prevalent, subjective, and significantly impact outcomes of opportunity among second language speakers. Twelve-item questionnaires were issued to the sample population, and their responses collated and analyzed for statistical significance. The findings indicate a difference in mean ratings of the measures of friendliness, intelligence, and employability between English and non-English L1 raters, though at a significance level precluding rejection of the null hypothesis. However, significant correlations were observed between ratings of friendliness, intelligence, and employability, and between ratings of accentedness and intelligence. These findings suggest that participants perceived more highly accented speech as less intelligent. Furthermore, ratings of friendliness, intelligence, and employability were closely interrelated across participants. Additional research is suggested to evaluate these relationships, oriented around achieving a wider and more representative population sample, and further investigation of the friendliness, intelligence, and employability constructs for sub-dimensionality.</etd_ms:description>

Investigating issues of fairness in the IELTS writing task for test takers</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Zaferanieh, Elaheh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research investigated the perceived fairness of the IELTS writing assessment from the perspectives of educators/examiners and test takers. Using a mixed methods approach, the study gathered quantitative data from questionnaires completed by 30 participants and qualitative information from interviews. Quantitative findings revealed dissatisfaction among educators, examiners, and test-takers with the IELTS writing assessment, emphasizing its lack of clarity of assessment criteria and fairness. Qualitative data identified four critical themes for both groups: Unclear Scoring Criteria, Cultural Bias, Life-Changing Consequences, and Technological Impact. Themes showed limitations within the scoring system and their impacts on test takers’ futures. Notably, the Life-Changing Consequences theme highlighted deep social impacts of writing scores which delayed university admissions, hindered job opportunities and complicated immigration processes for some candidates. The findings called for a re-evaluation of IELTS scoring criteria and advocated for clearer guidelines to mitigate subjectivity and bias. By tackling these issues, the study sought to improve fairness and lessen the unfair challenges for test takers, aligning the test more accurately with their true language abilities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Transporting goods across Canada’s vast landmass on a daily basis, trucks can be seen as carriers of the country’s prosperity. In the meantime, like many countries across the globe, Canada is currently suffering from a concerning truck driver shortage. Given Canada’s reliance on trucks, addressing this shortage is crucial. My qualitative study explores factors that affect the retention of immigrant, young, and women drivers, who are currently underrepresented as truck drivers, yet who will likely become the backbone of Canada’s trucking industry in light of its changing demographics. Based on the Job Demands-Resources Model, my study investigates the job demands that deter these drivers from staying in the industry and the job resources that encourage them to stay. Key findings highlight job demands including driving related working conditions, perceived discrimination, and exploitation that are critical to address, along with important job resources of financial and non-financial nature that need to be further encouraged to help reduce Canada’s truck driver shortage. My study provides practical recommendations to three levels of stakeholders – government agencies, industrial leaders, and the general public.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This study introduces a comprehensive framework for enhancing price forecasting in the oil (Brent and WTI) and natural gas (Henry Hub) markets, which play a critical role in the global economy. By integrating advanced deep learning models and ensemble methods, optimized through Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization (BO), the research improves predictive accuracy. Utilizing an extensive dataset from January 2010 to February 2024, the models were trained and validated. Results indicate that, in the oil market, the weighted ensemble model combining LSTM and GRU performs best, leveraging the strengths of both models. In the natural gas market, post-optimization, CNN proves most effective in capturing the market's volatility and trends. XGBoost also demonstrates strong performance in both markets, balancing predictive accuracy with training efficiency. These findings offer valuable insights for risk management and decision-making in the energy sector.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>I evaluate the ability of the mixture multiple change-point model to establish Canadian business cycle turning points dates. Following the technique by Camacho, Gadea, and Loscos (2022) I asses the efficacy and feasibility of this dating method in achieving turning point dates by comparing it with the already announced dates by the C.D. Howe Institute Business Cycle Council. Using key monthly economic indicators spanning the last 34 years, I find that this methodology successfully identifies three business cycle dates for Canada, offering valuable insights into the peaks and recessions the Canadian economy has likely experienced in the past. Nevertheless, It yields significant disparities when compared with the chronology established by the Howe Institute.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>foreign language effect, bilingualism, media literacy, credibility perceptions, Artificial Intelligence</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This study explores how media users determine credibility in the ever-evolving media landscape, centering the attention toward the impact language has on critical media literacy and how people interact and consider Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content. Considering research on bilingualism describing a tendency for bilinguals to differ in their decision-making when using their first (L1) and second (L2) language, a phenomenon known as the foreign language effect (Costa et al., 2013, 2014; Keysar et al., 2012), this study examined 24 university students Spanish (L1)–English (L2) bilinguals’ media literacy from the credibility perspective, with Facebook-like posts generated by ChatGPT in the two languages. Students reflected on the posts’ overall credibility, sharing likelihood, and text’s credibility in a mixed methods approach.
The findings suggest that students perceive English posts to be more credible than Spanish posts, with students considering their ability to analyze credibility better in Spanish. The results imply the existence of a confirmation bias, whereby students tend to consider the content they expect to see as more credible. This potential bias raises a concern as to people’s media literacy at a time when information can be easily generated by AI for malicious purposes (Hutchens, 2024). Supporting prior work exploring the relationship between the foreign language effect and identification of fake news (Caramancion, 2022; Muda et al., 2023), this study shows that bilinguals’ reliance on their L2 experience might disadvantage them in terms of their critical media literacy skills, limiting their ability to critically engage with information online.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>electric vehicles effects on the power grid considering smart charging/discharging: montréal case study</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>shamshirband, mehdi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized for their potential to save energy, reduce pollution, and protect the environment. This makes the promotion and adoption of EVs crucial for decreasing our reliance on oil, enhancing energy security at national and regional levels, and supporting sustainable economic and social development. Acknowledging these benefits has led to a strategic focus on encouraging the widespread use of EVs. In this regard, countries around the world have begun to implement policies aimed at accelerating the adoption of EVs. These policies range from incentives for EV purchases to investments in charging infrastructure, reflecting a commitment to transition to cleaner forms of transportation. As a part of these efforts, the Government of Canada has introduced new regulations that establish mandatory Zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales targets for manufacturers and importers of new passenger cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks. These regulations require that a minimum of 20 percent of new vehicles sold in Canada must be zero-emission by 2026, escalating to at least 60 percent by 2030 and reaching 100 percent by 2035.
In accordance with these new laws and policies, the province of Québec has set its own ambitious target of having two million EVs on the road of Québec by 2030. This goal has led to the need for this study to measure and analyze the impact of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) charging demand on both the current and future power network of Montréal, the largest city in the province of Québec. In this regard, this study considers the integration of Québec's ZEV policy on the city's grid and will evaluate how the expected growth in the number of PHEVs will affect the network's stability and efficiency. Therefore, a multi-objective problem has been presented in this research study to simultaneously maximize the benefits for PHEV owners while minimizing the power loss in the system for the current and future network of the city of Montréal. The proposed multi-objective problem is also developed using the Epsilon-Constraint technique, which facilitates solving the complex multi-objective function problem. In this regard, the load profiles of three different parts of the city of Montréal have been considered for specific reasons. The downtown area of Montréal has been chosen as it serves both commercial and residential purposes. To analyze the impact of PHEV charging in residential areas, Cote Saint Luc and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce have been included in the study, where both are considered primarily residential neighborhoods. Additionally, Montréal is well-known for its festivals and events, which led individuals to spend considerable time in the city for leisure. As a result, Quartier des Spectacles and the Old Port have been selected as essential areas where people gather during their leisure time. To address the above-mentioned issue and analyze the effect of PHEVs on the network of Montréal, two different phases and approaches were considered in this study: Immediate Charging, which only uses the Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) charging strategy, and Smart Charging, which uses both G2V and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) strategies with the assistance of an EV aggregator. Additionally, to validate the effectiveness of the Smart Charging results, an alternative approach known as Basic V2G was implemented. This Basic V2G approach serves as a basic V2G concept to evaluate and verify the advantages of using the Smart Charging scenario.</etd_ms:description>
