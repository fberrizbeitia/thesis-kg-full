        <etd_ms:title>XFEM based Multiscale Approach for the Analysis of Masonry Walls</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The increasing global emphasis on sustainable development has underscored the importance of understanding the mechanical behaviour of masonry materials in the context of modern construction practices. This thesis presents an X-FEM-based computational homogenization framework tailored for analysing heterogeneous masonry structures. The methodology leverages the advantages of the eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) in introducing phased changes and capture interface behaviour within the representative volume element (RVEs) to represent the material behaviour of masonry structures.

The proposed framework introduces techniques for calculating effective material properties, incorporating periodicity of the masonry wall structure, and addressing interface damage effects. A detailed derivation of the governing equations is presented, along with rigorous validation against benchmark studies and experimental results from the literature. The analysis encompasses multiple case studies, including parametric studies on RVE size, assumed boundary condition effects, and the impact of interface damage on homogenized properties. Results reveal the accuracy and robustness of the X-FEM based approach in capturing the homogenized behaviour masonry walls.

This study not only bridges gaps in existing computational techniques but also provides insights into optimizing modelling strategies for masonry homogenization. The developed framework holds significant potential for applications in structural analysis and the sustainable design of masonry structures, offering a reliable tool for engineers and researchers in the field of computational mechanics.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Enhancing Automated Testing With GUI Rendering Inference for
Mobile Applications</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Abdollahi, Ehsan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Increasingly complex mobile applications require more accurate methods of automated GUI testing.
Traditional testing frameworks relying on fixed delays or pixel-based image comparison methods
have a lot of limitations. Most of the time, these methods misclassify GUI rendering states, which
leads to false positives. This thesis proposes a new approach to these issues by the inference of the
rendering state of GUIs. Drawing on large-scale pre-trained image classification models like Vision
Mamba, it enables the accurate classification between rendered GUIs. It does this through a fine-
tuning process of a large model. It also involves more sophisticated model-training techniques to
ensure that the best is obtained. Instead, this system architecture’s semantic examination of GUI
elements goes deep into more meaningful matches of context and visual information well beyond
anything at the level of pixels.
The efficiency and accuracy of GUI testing will increase significantly with the proposed approach.
That is different from fixed throttles that introduce unnecessary delays: it guarantees automated
tests execute on fully rendered GUIs, which, in turn, reduces false positives. With this enhancement,
development teams will save time and resources. Deep learning-based classification introduces a
dynamic system that changes according to various GUI rendering scenarios; therefore, it is also
more robust than what is already available.
The contributions of this thesis are three-fold: it proposes a new deep learning-based approach
for inferring GUI rendering states, develops a high-quality dataset to support fine-tuning models,
and performs an in-depth comparative analysis of large image classification models for GUI testing.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Automatic Handwriting Analysis for Classifying Multi-Label Personality Traits using Transformer OCR</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Adeli Shamsabad, Marzieh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Handwriting analysis, or graphology, studies an individual’s psychological traits through handwriting patterns and features. It is used in forensic science, criminology, and disease diagnosis.

Previous studies have evaluated the correlation between psychological questionnaires and manual handwriting analysis, but results were inconsistent due to its limitations and human error. This research addresses these challenges by developing an automated handwriting analysis system using deep learning to predict multi-label personality traits based on the Big Five Factor Model (BFFM).

The proposed model is built on the Transformer OCR (TrOCR) architecture, pre-trained on diverse datasets, including handwritten texts like IAM. In this study, the text generation function is replaced with a classification approach to predict levels (Low, Average, High) of BFFM traits from handwriting samples. The model uses Focal Loss to handle class imbalance and Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits for accurate classification.

The dataset includes 873 French and 181 English handwriting samples from CENPARMI, originally labeled for Extraversion and Conscientiousness. It has been expanded to cover all five BFFM traits: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience, totaling 1,054 samples. Each sample is segmented into individual lines to improve generalization.

The model's performance is compared with ResNet50 and Vision Transformers (ViT Base 16 - 224 and 384). Results show that TrOCR outperforms them in accuracy and overall performance. For two personality traits, it achieves 90.05% accuracy, AUROC of 0.97, and F-Score of 89%. For all five traits, it reaches 89.01% accuracy, AUROC of 0.95, and F-Score of 87%. Extraversion shows the weakest performance (AUROC of 91), while Agreeableness performs best (AUROC of 97). These results highlight the model's effectiveness in classifying BFFM traits despite class imbalance.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Event graph optimization in RFI text documents using
hierarchical reinforcement learning and human feedback</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Ahmadinasab, Sareh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Requests for Information (RFIs) are essential tools for facilitating communication among stakeholders in construction project management. They serve as formal inquiries to clarify ambiguities, resolve uncertainties, and enhance coordination between project teams, ultimately supporting effective project execution. RFIs play a critical role in maintaining workflow efficiency, reducing misinterpretations, and addressing unforeseen challenges that arise during the construction process. However, despite their importance, RFIs can sometimes highlight underlying systemic inefficiencies or anomalies that, if left unaddressed, contribute to cost overruns, schedule delays, and project quality issues.
Identifying the root causes of such anomalies within RFIs is crucial for mitigating risks and improving decision-making. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is commonly employed to trace these issues back to their sources, allowing project managers and engineers to implement corrective measures. However, existing RCA approaches, many of which are based on event graphs, tend to rely on predefined rules or statistical correlations, which may not fully capture the dynamic and evolving nature of construction-related issues.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that integrates human feedback-augmented reinforcement learning to enhance RCA for the event graphs of text-based RFIs. Our method leverages expert insights as a core component of the HRL loop in optimizing and improving the accuracy and reliability of causal and temporal graphs by effectively identifying and correcting errors within the graphs themselves. Importantly, our method is explicitly designed for structured RFI text data in which events have been manually pre-extracted as part of a preprocessing pipeline. Specifically, we employ hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to systematically decompose the problem into multiple levels of decision-making, allowing for more structured learning and adaptation. 
To validate our approach, we conduct experiments using the Causal-TimeBank dataset, a benchmark corpus annotated with explicit temporal and causal relationships. The reason for choosing this benchmark is largely due to the lack of publicly available RFIs with enriched text data and annotated causal/temporal events. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional RCA techniques by effectively identifying and correcting errors within causal and temporal graphs. The integration of human expertise ensures that the model remains adaptable to real-world complexities, enhancing its ability to capture nuanced relationships that might otherwise be overlooked by automated approaches. Ultimately, this work contributes to the advancement of intelligent RCA systems by combining human intuition with machine learning to create more robust, interpretable, and actionable root cause analyses in construction project management.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Academic articles in their digital form are skeuomorphic: a linear translation from paper to screen. This linear translation makes engagement with digital text awkward and also creates a boundary between the form of the article and the form of the digital reader. Attempts to solve this problem retain the PDF form and enhance it by revising either the ISO standard, or readers that can read a certain type of PDF formats with plugins. 

Based on the assumption that the existing forms and tools for academic reading and publication are saturated, this research re-imagines and speculates on a \textit{digital-first form of the academic article} that breaks the constraints imposed by PDFs. With a Research through Design (RtD) approach -- iterative prototyping and design journaling, this project calls for a paradigm shift: from Article as Files to Article as Software. It re-imagines the form of the digital academic article as a digital-first artifact, and explores the design space of the digital-first academic article (DFA). Instead of setting it up for printing and archival, the goal is to establish a unique identity of the digital research article that affords enhanced reading and learning from academic text.

        <etd_ms:title>On Translanguaging and Learner Affect: An Action Research Study on ESL Secondary Classrooms Through the Use of a Multilingual Presentation Project</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Antonopoulos, Ioanna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Amid controversies surrounding multilingual policies in a classroom, something that has become a key component of education in recent years is student’s emotional well-being and how emotions influence learning (Song, Howard, Olazabal-Arias, 2022). This action-research study examines the impact of translanguaging on student engagement and affect in a secondary-level English as a Second Language (ESL) classroom in Quebec. While traditional ESL instruction emphasizes English-only policies, translanguaging encourages students to use their full linguistic repertoire, supporting comprehension and participation. Conducted in a French-medium high school, this study involved multilingual presentations where students used their first languages (L1s) alongside English. Teacher-researcher observations through field notes were analyzed to assess student collaboration, participation, and emotional responses. The findings of this research suggest that the use of translanguaging can foster engagement, reduce presentation anxiety and promote inclusivity. This research contributes to multilingual education by highlighting translanguaging as a strategy to enhance student confidence and learning in diverse, multilingual classrooms.

        <etd_ms:creator>Azizmohammadi, Shaghayegh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper studies how returns to educational degrees has evolved in Canada from 2005 to 2020 by combining data from the 2006 and 2021 Canadian Census. The study uses a two-class finite mixture model to capture unobserved heterogeneity that may be correlated with individual characteristics, in a way that resembles the use of fixed effects in a panel data setting. The mixture model reveals two distinct groups and highlights unobserved differences in earnings
that standard models could miss. The findings show that while higher education still leads to higher earnings, the return to education has empirically declined over time for individuals
with graduate degrees. In contrast, returns to college and trade-level education have increased, suggesting that practical skills has become more valuable in the Canadian job market. These findings reveal the changing nature of the Canadian economy and help policymakers and educators improve education and training programs to better meet the needs of today’s job market.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Securing Control of Clustered DC Microgrids with Multiple Interlinking Converters</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Babazadeh Dizaji, Ramin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The integration of multiple direct current (DC) microgrids offers a resilient and efficient solution for modern energy demands, particularly with the increasing adoption of intermittent renewable energy sources. However, the reliance on communication networks for coordinating multiple interlinking converters (MICs) introduces vulnerabilities, particularly to False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), which can significantly disrupt system stability and operation.
This thesis presents AI-driven cyber-defense strategies to protect clustered DC microgrids interconnected via MICs against FDIAs.
At the primary control level, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based anomaly detection framework is developed to identify FDIAs in real time. Once an attack is detected, the system autonomously transitions to a localized power-balancing control to maintain operational stability.
At the secondary control level, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based signal estimation strategy is proposed to detect injected FDIAs and subsequently reconstruct compromised control signals, thereby maintaining MIC coordination.
Extensive simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their ability to enhance microgrid resilience against various FDIA scenarios, including time-varying and unbounded attacks.

        <etd_ms:title>Links Between Parent-Child Storybook Reading and Children’s Vocabulary Acquisition and Writing Skills</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Bazurto Martinez, Angie Xilena</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this study, 55 parents completed a Title Recognition Test (TRT) to measure their familiarity with children’s books, serving as a proxy for children’s exposure to storybooks at home. At school, children participated in three shared storybook reading sessions, with each session focusing on a new target vocabulary word. After each storybook reading at school, children were asked to write a response reflecting what they learned from the book. The story responses were later scored for lexical diversity (Type-Token Ratio) and invented spelling sophistication (using an adaptation from Gentry and Ouellette’s Monster Test, 2019). Vocabulary learning was also assessed by directly measuring target word definitions during a post-test activity. The findings revealed that children whose parents scored better on the TRT showed significantly greater lexical diversity in their responses. In addition, they demonstrated better learning of the target vocabulary introduced during the reading sessions at school. Conversely, children’s invented spelling was unrelated to their parents’ TRT scores. These results suggest that spelling may be more influenced by explicit instruction in letters and sounds, as found in previous research. Taken together, this study enriches our understanding of how parent-child shared reading experiences relate to children’s vocabulary use in writing. It also promotes free writing activities as valuable tools for assessing early literacy development.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Aeroelasticity and gust response of wings equipped with a distributed propulsion system</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>Aeroelasticity, DEP, Flutter, Gust Response, UAM, Parametric Study, Tiltrotor</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis studies the aeroelastic behaviour of wings designed for urban air mobility (UAM) through sensitivity analyses, parametric studies, flutter envelopes, and gust responses. As urban traffic congestion intensifies, innovative transportation solutions such as UAM vehicles are gaining attention for their accessibility, reliability, travel time, and reduced environmental impacts. However, their lightweight structures and the versatility of their distributed electric propulsion (DEP) system make them somewhat different from conventional aircraft, thus necessitating fresh investigations into the aeroelastic stability and response of UAM vehicles.

The study employs a wing model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, with propulsors represented as follower forces and an unsteady aerodynamic model in the time domain. The governing equations are discretized using Galerkin's method, with the flutter speed and gust response determined via eigenvalue analysis and time integration, respectively. A building-block approach is employed, starting with a clean-wing configuration, followed by single- then multi-propulsor configurations with tiltrotor capabilities, and finalizing with the implementation of the finite aspect ratio effects. 

Sensitivity and parametric studies assess the influence of key wing and propulsor parameters on flutter speed. It is found that some parameters significantly reduce flutter speed, with certain cases leading to a 50 % drop or even preventing flight. It is also observed that distributing the propulsion system across the wingspan is beneficial for the stability of the wing, up to a certain value of thrust. Gust response analyses under sharp-edged and 1-cosine profiles reveal that propulsors strongly influence transient and steady-state deformations. Finite aspect ratio effects increase flutter speed values, highlighting the conservatism of strip theory, but also reduce damping, making gust responses worse in some cases. These findings provide design insights for DEP-equipped wings, guiding future UAM aircraft development. Further work will incorporate propeller slipstream effects and configurations optimization strategies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis addresses the perennial problem of exceptionalism in exhibiting women artists and examines such exceptionalism as a product of the institutional political and economic agendas imposed by corporate and state investors in art museums. Using the 2017 retrospective exhibition of Fahrelnissa Zeid’s oeuvre, which concluded the four-year International Arts Partnership between Tate Modern and its sponsor Deutsche Bank, I interrogate Tate’s characterization of Fahrelnissa Zeid as an artist ignored because of her gender and international origin who was “saved” by the Deutsche Bank International Arts Partnership. I demonstrate that both institutions manipulate the art histories and exhibition promotion they produce by relying on a rhetoric of neoliberal feminism and performative progressivism to achieve their political and financial goals.I also expose the extent of corporate and state intervention in the cultural field and explain the deleterious results for the independence and critical potential of bank-sanctioned arts initiatives. By identifying the causes of historiographic and promotional manipulation in the Tate Modern/Deutsche Bank retrospective, I re-examine Zeid’s history to provide evidence contrary to the reductive institutional history which Tate and Deutsche Bank produced.</etd_ms:description>

History, Impact and Assessment of the Prosperity Gospel in the United States</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Campbell, Hugh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The Prosperity Gospel is not a gospel. It has not been subjected to the process of canonization, consequently, it will not be found in the Bible. It is a term pejoratively ascribed to evangelical Christian groups who believe that God wants them to be wealthy and that their wealth is a sign of God’s favour. Obtaining this wealth appears to be contingent on the strength of one’s faith. However, a yard stick of that faith can only be determined by how wealthy or poor a person is or will become. A wealthy person in theory has a greater faith than a poorer person. Acting on the claimed premise that the Bible is inerrant, Prosperity Gospel adherents use a fundamentalist approach in their hermeneutic. However, their area of concentration is mainly with Scripture that advocates wealth and riches. Although there are ample verses in the Bible to support this point of view, PGAs embrace a particular hermeneutic. This thesis will examine the Prosperity Gospel, how it evolved, its purpose, who are its adherents, who are its leaders, and any impact it may have on the social reality of the United States.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines South African artist Zanele Muholi’s self-portrait series Somnyama Ngonyama (Hail the Dark Lioness) (2012–ongoing) as an alternative archive that inserts Black
Queer bodies into South Africa’s visual culture. Through over four hundred black-and-white self-portraits, Muholi reclaims agency over the historical erasure and misrepresentation of Black Queer individuals in South African archives. Their work challenges colonial and apartheid-era visual legacies by engaging with ethnographic photography, identity documentation, and institutionalized archives that have historically dehumanized Black South Africans and excluded Queer narratives. Situating Somnyama Ngonyama within the framework of Black, Queer, and archival practices, this thesis argues that Muholi’s work functions as a self-archive, challenging the rigid, exclusionary structures of South African records of Black
Queer experiences. By foregrounding the body as an archive of personal and collective experiences, Muholi’s series offers a sensorial and subjective mode of archiving that resists colonial and heteropatriarchal knowledge production. Ultimately, I argue that understood as a self-archive, Somnyama Ngonyama functions as an activist tool to insert the presence of Black Queer individuals in South Africa’s visual landscape.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Engaging Communities in Newfoundland and Labrador Journalism: A Case Study of News Coverage of Project Nujio’qonik in Port au Port.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Cole, Abigail</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In Newfoundland and Labrador, the decline of local news is problematic for rural communities and democracy. Considering this decline, this thesis focuses on the rural community of the Port au Port Peninsula, as it faces the introduction of a massive wind farm project (Project Nujio’Qonik). This thesis explores the evolution of journalism from traditional concepts such as watchdog journalism, to engaged and community-centered journalism. This thesis seeks to answer three research questions: How do community members in Port au Port feel about journalism efforts and news reporting in the context of a news shortage? How can journalism adapt to address the loss of local news in the province to better engage communities in the face of significant developments like Project Nujio’Qonik? What perspectives on the wind farm are most prominent in Newfoundland and Labrador news coverage, and to what extent are community voices represented? 
Qualitative interviews with community members from Port au Port were used to answer the first two research questions, and a basic analysis of the voices quoted across the wind farm project’s news coverage from August 2023 to August 2024 was conducted to answer the third question. This thesis finds that community members are not content with reporting efforts, due to perceived bias and not enough local news. Community members shared that they want more factual, unbiased reporting, that involves the community more in the process. They also want more local journalism physically present in the community. The analysis also found that government and corporate voices were quoted significantly more than community voices. Therefore, this thesis suggests that engaged and community-centered journalism techniques, by involving the community more in the reporting process, could work to restore community members' satisfaction with reporting.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Memory, Culture, and Capitalism: Reframing and Refracting the Past Through Vaporwave</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Coleman, Marielle</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the aesthetic and cultural significance of vaporwave, an internet-born movement that blends music, visuals, and digital platforms to critique late capitalism and reimagine collective memory. Drawing on theoretical frameworks from postmodernism, media studies, and cultural theory, this research examines vaporwave’s materiality, its relationship to the internet’s rapidly expanding platform culture, and its status as both a critique and product of late capitalism. The study highlights vaporwave’s use of recontextualized media, its DIY-inspired practice, and the ways it engages with globalized systems of communication to produce a genre that is at once ephemeral (or vaporous) and enduring.

Through close analysis of vaporwave’s visual identity online, this thesis argues that the movement embodies a tension between cultural critique and aesthetic indulgence. On the one hand, vaporwave’s reliance on platforms like YouTube reveals the transformative impact of digital spaces on cultural production, fostering new forms of community and redefining the concept of the music scene. On the other hand, vaporwave’s reliance on pastiche, simulacrum, and cultural recycling, as well as its ambivalent messaging on consumer culture, raises questions about its potential as a form of political resistance.

Ultimately, this work positions vaporwave as a vital lens through which to understand the interplay of memory, culture, and capitalism in contemporary media, while also reflecting on the broader implications of internet-mediated art in the 21st century.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Contant, Emilie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines how Christi Belcourt’s works, Wisdom of the Universe and Offerings to Save the World, unsettle the legacy of the Canadian landscape tradition by centering the perspectives of Indigenous women and being grounded in traditional knowledge and practices. By situating Belcourt’s works in relation to established landscape paintings by the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson, I demonstrate how her practice challenges romanticized and extractive representations of the landscape, instead highlighting the interconnection of all living beings and the fragility of our ecosystems. Drawing on the work of scholars from Indigenous studies, ecology, Indigenous feminisms, and art history, this thesis examines how Belcourt innovatively adapts storytelling, Indigenous ecologies, and Métis floral beadwork to the canvas to redefine the possibilities of contemporary Indigenous art.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The play Nuns is about Abby, a new student at Concordia University living in the Grey Nuns residence building. The play focuses on Abbys conflicted relationship with her own identity, and her mother. Despite a budding romantic relationship with a girl named Kaeli, she chooses to date a boy named Andrew to avoid acknowledging her own sexual identity. Her rejection of her identity allows her to fit within the role that her mother expects of her. On Halloween Abby’s avoidance of her sexuality comes to a head during a Ouija board game. The game opens the veil and allows one of the previous Nuns, Margaret, to begin haunting Abby as a means of guiding her to accept her identity. 
	The play focuses on themes of identity, family, freedom and gender roles. Abby is motivated to maintain a positive relationship with her Christian mom through fear. She worries that by accepting her identity as a gay woman, her relationship with her mother will fail. On the other hand, she struggles with avoiding her very real feelings for Kaeli, the object of her desire, who continues to intrude into the fantasy relationship she has created with Andrew. Despite the expectations of her parents, she will eventually accept her identity and reject the lifestyle that she has been expected to follow. As such, the text also grapples with ideas of found family, and connection.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Metric Media is known for its vast network of US-based pseudo-local news sites propagating specific ideologies, operating beyond traditional mass media manipulation techniques. By micro-targeting societal segments on divisive issues, Metric Media presents a nuanced form of content dissemination, raising questions about its impact on public opinion and welfare. The case study employed sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and social media engagement metrics to analyze content from July 2019 to January 2024. It offered a comprehensive view of Metric Media's thematic focus and the resonance of its narratives among communities. Additionally, it explored the role of data scraping and visualization in highlighting the organization's strategic approaches to news dissemination. This investigation not only elucidated Metric Media's use as a political tool across ideologies but also underscored the importance of data-driven methodologies in enhancing public awareness of media influence. The findings contribute to the discourse on digital media manipulation, emphasizing the need for critical engagement with news sources.

        <etd_ms:title>Investigating municipal Access to Information via news coverage of Montreal’s housing crisis</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Crebassa, Noa</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Access to information, media law</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This study seeks to reveal the role of Access to Information (ATI) and public records in local journalism by conducting a thematic analysis of 107 news media articles about Montreal’s housing crisis, and by examining original and previously released Access to Information request packages. This work highlights how local news media have covered the housing crisis thus far, with a deliberate focus on the sources and angles used, and how they might address the issue differently going forward, with increased focus on using official documents and ATI requests in the coverage. Importantly, this study focuses on Montreal’s municipal ATI system, as previous work in academia has mostly focused on either Canada’s federal ATI system or provincial/territorial systems. 	

This study reveals that, in stories about the housing crisis, local news media have tended to favour the voices of politicians and official statements, while only a few rare outlets sporadically use ATI to deepen their reporting. 

This study recognizes that tight deadlines in news work and long delays in the municipal ATI system are in part responsible for local journalists’ heavy reliance on political sources and official statements. However, the result of not using ATI as a journalistic source leads to a journalism that remains at the surface level and fails to provide citizens the information they are entitled to, that would allow them to make more informed decisions about municipal policies related to housing and municipal elections. With this important function of local journalism in mind, this study suggests increased use of ATI requests in gaining a deeper understanding of complex issues that directly target citizens.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This philosophical inquiry examined the use of therapeutic songwriting (TS) within a trauma-informed care (TIC) approach to support the processing of adverse childhood experiences within Substance Use Disorder (SUD) recovery. Drawing on the integral use of both outcome-oriented and experience-oriented songwriting methods (Bruscia, 2014) to support the processing of adverse childhood experiences (Kirkland, 2022), an argument was conceptualized and articulated by mapping specific songwriting elements (Baker, 2015) onto the specific principles of trauma-informed care. Relevant literature on SUD and SUD recovery, TIC, and therapeutic songwriting in SUD recovery was explicated to establish a foundation for the argument. Data analysis focused on specific songwriting elements and their potential to support key principles of TIC. Key findings demonstrated the potential for the utilization of a) the song components to support the TIC principles of safety and trustworthiness and transparency; b) the songwriting process to support the TIC principles of peer support, collaboration and mutuality, and cultural, historical and gender issues; c) the songwriting artifact to support the TIC principle of empowerment, voice and choice. Clinical, research, and educational implications are discussed along with limitations of the study.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>De Luca, Rebecca</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The current exploratory study involves the implementation of a shortened Mentalization-Based Training (MBT) for parents of preschool children without prior diagnoses related to cognitive, intellectual and/or behavioural challenges. It explores the triadic link between parenting self-efficacy, parenting stress and mentalization (i.e., parental reflective functioning). The research questions are: (1) To what extent does participation in a MBT program affect parents’ reflective thinking and mentalization capacity? (2) To what extent does participation in a MBT program affect parental self-efficacy? (3) To what extent does participation in a MBT program impact parental stress levels? (4) To what extent does participation in a MBT program impact the ways in which parents make attributions about their children’s behaviours and misbehaviours and (5) To what extent does participation in a MBT program affect parents’ attitudes about discipline? A total of five parents took part in the study and took part in two workshops. The Tool to Measure Parenting Self-Efficacy (TOPSE), the Parenting Stress Scale (PSS), the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ), as well as semi-structured interviews were conducted before and after the MBT workshops. The results showed that parents demonstrated emerging mentalizing behaviours following the MBT workshops. However, the MBT workshops’ effect on parenting stress and parenting self-efficacy varied according to: (1) parent’s gender; (2) marital status and spousal support; (3) having a support network; (4) parents’ childhood experiences; and (5) parents’ perceptions of their children’s temperament and needs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Experimental Evaluation of Rover Mobility Prediction Methods using Single Wheel Experiments</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Demishkevich, Alexander</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Multiple lunar exploration activities from around the world are driving the development of small skid-steer rovers for Moon missions. Single wheel experiments are commonly done to approximate the mobility of a rover design. This research aims to evaluate the limitations and accuracy of simple approximation models. In this work, single-wheel and full rover laboratory experimentation methods are described for systematic comparison of wheel designs in point turns and slope climbing. The effects of lunar gravity are accounted for using Granular Scaling Laws and GRC-1 lunar simulant in all experiments. Single wheel experiments are paired with simple theoretical models to predict full rover performance. The accuracy of the predictions is confirmed using scaled tests with a full rover.  Slanted grousers are shown to be compared favorably against V-offset grousers for point turns, achieving successful point turning with approximately 30\% slip in single-wheel and full rover experiments. This also showed that single wheel experiments can accurately predict full rover performance in point turns. On the other hand, slope climbing predictions had a substantial amount of errors. In part, this error was found to be explained by the diameter/width value of the wheel, with larger values being associated to a higher prediction error. To reduce prediction error a correction factor can be approximated by applying a correction factor to rigid wheel test data.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Art of Uncertainty: Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Daphne du Maurier</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Denhez, Caroline S.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Daphne du Maurier</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This research undertakes an analysis of Daphne du Maurier's novelistic achievements, challenging the standard genre classifications often assigned to her work and seeking to define the fundamental aspects of her narrative strategies. Moving beyond the constraints of genre conventions and biographical interpretations, the central aim is to illuminate the inherent literary power of her fiction. To this end, the study examines a carefully chosen selection of seven novels spanning her extensive literary career (nearly four decades): Jamaica Inn (1936), Rebecca (1938), My Cousin Rachel (1951), The Scapegoat (1957), The Flight of the Falcon (1965), The House on the Strand (1969), and Rule Britannia (1972), with the explicit exclusion of works based on factual or historical events.
The findings of this research reveal several key insights. Primarily, it argues that analyzing Daphne du Maurier's novels through the lens of genre conventions is not the most fruitful approach. Instead, it advocates for an analysis centered on the concept of Uncertainty. Furthermore, it identifies a discernible literary chronology, organized into three distinct cycles: the Gothic Romance cycle, the Masculine cycle, and the Speculative cycle. Finally, this thesis observes the author's dynamic relationship with genre conventions, emphasizing her consistent resistance to being bound by any single category and the proactive creation of her own writing conditions to sustain her exploration of uncertainty.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>feminism, fascism, far-right, political theology, experience, Lonergan, ultranationalist, conservative, traditional, Italy, theological assessment, Giorgia Meloni</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores women’s experiences in far-right societies using multiple theological assessments and prime minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, as the main test case. Elected in 2022 but having held right-wing leadership positions for most of her life, Meloni is opposed to issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, and surrogacy, and aims to limit these rights as well as the rights of women and other minorities in Italy with the goal of reverting back to Italy’s traditional, Christian lifestyle. This thesis delves into issues such as feminism, fascism, and the far-right – situating and defining Meloni’s beliefs and political actions and detailing how they are impacting Italian women’s experiences. This research determines if Meloni is adhering to some type of feminism, if her government can be considered fascist, and it pinpoints how much of her politics is taking place online, as well as certain repercussions that come with this. Using a comparative methodological approach, this thesis compares Meloni and her party to other female right-wing politicians in Europe, as well as other right-wing politicians in North America, at present. This research draws on political theology since religion has made its way into her politics. Thus, it is essential to perform theological assessments on Meloni to determine her method as well as if her views are rooted in accurate theological ideas. Here, contextual theology, Lonergan’s notion of the human good, and feminist theological approaches are vital. Through these theological assessments, this thesis concludes that Meloni is afraid for her country’s cultural identity and believes she is doing good by women and minorities but is allowing for oppression in Italy to continue.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>How has Remote Work Self-Efficacy Changed After a Quarter Century?</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Diplarakis, Emmanuel</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The purpose of this research was to replicate and extend Staples et al.’s (1999) study to determine if their findings are consistent relative to modern remote work models to provide contextually relevant suggestions for managers to enact policies that leverage remote work to benefit their employees and organization. The study consisted of assessing the mechanisms that lead remote workers to experience enhanced performance and improved well-being. In addition to the model illustrated in Staple et al.’s (1999) study, I also examined whether technology industries moderate the relationships between antecedents of remote work self-efficacy, and if remote work intensity, the degree an employee works from home, moderates the relationships between remote work self-efficacy and outcomes. Through a combination of using Prolific and convenience sampling, I obtained 434 valid responses. I then used SPSS to conduct regression analysis to test hypotheses. The results in general confirm Staples et al.’s (1999) findings. I found that modelling best practices by manager, IT experience and training, and general computer self-efficacy were positively associated with remote work self-efficacy; while computer anxiety had a negative association. Furthermore, remote work self-efficacy had positive associations with remote work performance, job satisfaction, affective commitment, ability to cope, and a negative association with job stress. In terms of moderation effects, there is a stronger, positive relationship between general computer self-efficacy and remote work self-efficacy for employees working in technology industries than those working in non-technology industries. Theoretical, practical contributions, and future research directions are discussed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Irish Big House Basements: A Study of Floor Plans, 1730s–1925</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Examinations of the basements of Irish country houses are underrepresented in current scholarship, and few historians use as sources the architectural drawings that depict them. This thesis aims to address the resulting gaps by using a sample of 43 floor plans for the basement levels of 29 country houses across the island of Ireland to analyze the work of architects and how these sources can be used to study these buildings that have fascinated the general public for centuries. The plans are examined based on their materiality and as visual layouts, and the considerations facing architects when designing country houses are discussed.
New statistics are produced about aspects of Irish country house basements such as their depth relative to ground-level, how many rooms they contained, and their general functions. Despite its scope remaining within the realm of architectural planning and based solely on floor plans, this thesis generates research useful to architectural and social historians, especially those conducting “history from below,” and suggests several avenues of further research.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Impacts of Uncertainty of Predation Risk in Trinidadian Guppies</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Dumaresq Synnott, Félixe</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study investigates how prey species, specifically Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), cope with ecological uncertainty in predator-prey dynamics. Ecological uncertainty arises from conflicting and/or unreliable environmental cues, especially in ecosystems impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, which may directly influence prey decision-making and behaviour. This work explores how prey balance risk and safety in unpredictable environments, offering new insights into the adaptive strategies they use.
Chapter 1 looks at how conflicting safety and risk cues influence neophobia, the fear of novelty. The results show that guppies exposed to contradictory cues were more neophobic, exhibiting reduced movement, which supports the hypothesis that uncertainty leads to greater caution. Conversely, guppies conditioned to safety cues showed a preference for novelty, highlighting that they engage with new experiences when they feel that these are safe. These findings suggest that neophobia may be an adaptive response to environments where risk signals are unclear, particularly in areas disturbed by human activity.
Chapter 2 examines how anthropogenic disturbances contribute to ecological uncertainty which influence prey behaviour. Through field and lab experiments, it was found that guppies from high predation-risk and disturbed environments exhibited more caution and took longer to explore or return to disturbed areas. Guppies from low predation-risk environments, however, were more exploratory. This suggests that human disturbances increase uncertainty, driving prey to adopt more conservative, risk-avoidant strategies.
Ultimately, this study highlights how environmental unpredictability shapes risk-averse behaviours like neophobia. As human impacts on ecosystems continue to intensify, understanding ecological uncertainty is crucial for predicting long-term effects on biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Influence of hydrogen on the electrical resistivity of 4340 and 300M high-strength steels</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Eftekhari, Hosna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Hydrogen embrittlement of steel components is a significant technological challenge, especially in the aerospace industry. Hydrogen is introduced into the steel during production and post-treatment. Trace quantities of hydrogen, as small as one-hundredth of parts per million, have the potential to induce embrittlement. Detection of hydrogen is not feasible by many conventional methods used to detect other elements as a result of its low atomic weight. Implementing a non-destructive method to measure hydrogen levels would greatly enhance the precision of quality control procedures. This study attempts to develop an approach for assessing hydrogen content in 4340 and 300M steel using electrical resistivity measurements. Specimens were charged with hydrogen using the electrochemical method and their hydrogen content was measured using thermal desorption spectroscopy. The change in resistivity was measured before and after hydrogen charging using the four-probe method. The findings reveal that the presence of hydrogen can be detected by the rise in electrical resistivity. To distinguish the impact of hydrogen on electrical resistivity from its effect on steel structure, the recovery of resistivity was measured after hydrogen desorption. The recovery of resistivity showed that hydrogen has an effect on electrical resistivity that is independent of microstructural damage seen in the absence of mechanical loading. This study illustrates that electrical resistivity measurement can potentially serve as the foundation for a novel, rapid, and non-destructive analytical technique for determining hydrogen content in high-strength steel components.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>El Hraiki, Lina</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines how robust optimization can address the operational uncertainties faced by APIA, a major Moroccan olive oil producer. In an industry marked by fluctuating yields, shifting costs, and unpredictable market demand, robust optimization provides a practical approach to making decisions that remain reliable and nearly optimal, even when conditions change. The model developed in this research incorporates robust optimization techniques into APIA’s operations, balancing strategic long-term planning with the need for real-time adaptability. By allowing for scenario-based flexibility, the model tailors the level of conservatism to reflect specific uncertainties, ensuring solutions are both practical and resilient, even under worst-case scenarios. Scalable and computationally efficient, the model developed is designed to support key operational decisions in procurement, production, transportation and storage. Through numerical experiments, this thesis demonstrates how the model helps optimize APIA’s operations, reducing costs while maintaining operational stability. By managing variability effectively, this research offers APIA a strategic tool to navigate the complexities of the agro-industrial sector, improve profitability, and achieve sustainable growth.
Keywords: robust optimization, operational parameter uncertainty, olive oil supply chain.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Efficient Mapping and Navigation System for Weed Removal Robot in Confined Garden Spaces</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Elkhatib, Mohammed</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Autonomous navigation and mapping technologies are reshaping how robots
interact with their surroundings, enabling a wide range of applications. This the-
sis introduces an autonomous mapping and navigation system for a mobile robot
tailored for weed control in confined, outdoor garden environments. Unlike indoor
robots that often rely on joystick-based manual mapping, the proposed system is
fully automated, delivering a seamless, user-friendly setup experience optimized
for backyard use. The solution leverages Google Cartographer for real-time
SLAM and AMCL for adaptive localization. To optimize exploration coverage,
the robot uses a combination of random exploration for initial mapping and
structured exploration to target unexplored areas effectively. The integrated
A* algorithm ensures efficient path planning and reliable obstacle avoidance
throughout navigation. Extensive simulations and real-world testing demonstrate
the robot’s ability to autonomously map and navigate complex backyard lay-
outs with minimal human intervention. The system shows resilience to dynamic
obstacles, sensor limitations, and uneven terrain, confirming its robustness and
practical utility. A significant contribution of this research is the development of
a fully autonomous, modular navigation framework that removes the need
for manual setup while ensuring high-accuracy mapping. By simplifying navi-
gation in small-scale, unstructured outdoor environments, this work provides a
functional and scalable solution for backyard maintenance and extends the ap-
plicability of autonomous robotics beyond controlled indoor settings. This thesis
highlights how integrating SLAM, adaptive exploration, and planning can provide
effective autonomy for lawn care, contributing to innovation in outdoor robotic
systems.</etd_ms:description>

This project addresses intersections between the fields of gerontology, art education, arts-based pedagogies, geragogy, as well as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease research and care. Through interviews with art educators, I investigate experiences and approaches to adult art education for those living with memory loss using interdisciplinary perspectives. This study highlights various approaches to teaching and learning in recreation education programming within clinical and community settings. This study has two core objectives: 1) Examine the structures and approaches used in art education for individuals with memory loss through interviews with art educators; 2) Map connections and gaps between art educators’ experiences and existing literature on teaching, learning, and artmaking with individuals living with dementia.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Co-creation is always considered an outcome of positive behaviors. Conversely, co-destruction is mostly treated as a negative outcome of negative or destructive behaviors. However, there are instances that negative or destructive behaviors paradoxically create value. Conducting nine interviews and analysing ten extensive threads, my findings suggest that under circumstances, there are more angles to destructive behaviors rather than being merely destructive! Exploring Dota 2 players’ motifs for trash talking that is a negative behavior, I identified four types of value in trash talking. First trash talking for the pleasure of winning, second trash talking for entertainment and fun, third trash talking for gameplay self-perception enhancement and feeling better about oneself and fourth trash talking for social bonding and friendship ties. These findings contribute to the co-creation and trash talking literatures challenging the predominant ideologies that co-creation is always stemmed in positive behaviors and that trash talking is always a negative behavior.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Eslam, Fathelbab</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Indoor air quality (IAQ) modeling is essential for evaluating and optimizing modern buildings' ventilation systems, pollutant dispersion, and occupant health. Accurate IAQ predictions rely on calibrated models that effectively represent real-world conditions. This study focuses on calibrating the CONTAM multi-zone airflow model using two advanced methodologies: the Ensemble Kalman Filter (ENKF) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). To improve the model's predictive accuracy, calibration efforts targeted key parameters, including initial CO₂ concentrations, generation rates, and occupancy counts. These methods were validated using CO₂ tracer gas experiments conducted across multiple test scenarios, including room-to-floor and floor-to-floor dispersion dynamics. Results demonstrate that ENKF calibration achieved RMSE reductions of approximately 25% in complex multi-zone airflow scenarios, with CVRMSE consistently below the ASHRAE-recommended threshold of 15%. The GA method performed similarly in accuracy but required higher computational resources, making it more suitable for static or offline calibration processes. The calibrated models were subsequently applied in a case study to analyze CO₂ quanta dispersion in an experimental building with controlled ventilation strategies. This study investigated the effects of varying fresh air percentages (10% to 100%) and stairwell pressurization on contaminant transport. Results from the calibrated models revealed critical insights, such as the effectiveness of high fresh air intake in mitigating pollutant concentrations and the impact of pressurization strategies on inter-zone airflow. These findings highlight the practical value of calibration in refining IAQ predictions and informing operational strategies. This research underscores the importance of hybrid calibration techniques for improving the reliability of multi-zone IAQ models and their application in dynamic building environments. By integrating calibrated models into operational planning, stakeholders can optimize ventilation performance, reduce energy consumption, and enhance occupant safety in diverse building types.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>digital visual culture, affect, social movements, counter publics</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis looks at the online and offline affective reverberations of the 2021 Colombian National Strike through its visual culture to understand what counter public digital expressions reveal about how Colombians engaged with the events and the affective histories of the nation surrounding these moments. My goal is to show how the interplay between material and digital spaces contributed to the emergence of a new affective structure. I argue that by looking at the images and affects that were shared online, it is possible to see a shift from an affective structure of fear and apathy—promoted by the visuality of the Colombian armed conflict and anti-insurgent propaganda—to a new, and perhaps temporary, structure of “awakening.” By following particular nodes in the strike’s visual and digital affective fabrics, I show how spaces like Twitter (now X) not only offered an affective and political arena to share, discuss and enact practices of resistance, but also became “affective archives” or “counter archives” through which these changes could be traced. 
My thesis looks at affect through and as digital images to understand their textures and the ways in which visual activism and digital images touch us. Focusing on two particular moments/spaces that took place during the strike, I use the figure of the hero to understand how these affective changes happened, and, at the same time, how national identity was renegotiated.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Vertical Mergers as a Strategic Response to Economic Uncertainty: Evidence from U.S. M&amp;A Activity (2006–2020)</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the impact of vertical and horizontal mergers and acquisitions on investor wealth, specifically focusing on how economic uncertainty influences merger behavior and outcomes. The study follows Fan &amp; Goyal's (2006) methodology and distinguishes between vertical and horizontal mergers using input-output tables from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The first hypothesis posits that economic uncertainty increases the proportion of vertical mergers. In contrast, the second explores whether vertical mergers generate higher abnormal returns in uncertain times compared to unrelated mergers. Using a sample of over 100,000 U.S. M&amp;A transactions from 2006 to 2020, sourced from SDC Platinum, the research classifies mergers by vertical relatedness and applies event study analysis and multiple linear regression methodology. Findings reveal a consistent statistical relationship between economic health indicators (S&amp;P 500 variations) and the proportion of vertical mergers. Furthermore, results from event studies and regression models suggest that vertical relatedness has a significant positive effect on CAAR during periods of economic instability, particularly from 2006 to 2010 and 2016–2020. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUI) support the selection of instability periods and confirms the findings between economic instability, uncertainty and CAR variations. The study contributes to the M&amp;A literature by demonstrating that vertical integration may serve as a strategic risk-mitigation tool during volatile economic conditions, delivering higher value to investors than horizontal mergers under similar circumstances.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Feyzi, Melika</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates the challenges and opportunities within the MedTech entrepreneurship ecosystem, focusing on the collaborative dynamics between startups and incubators. The research identifies the specific needs of MedTech startups, including regulatory guidance, resource access, and specialized mentorship, which are often unmet in general incubation settings. Through a comprehensive literature review, thematic analysis of expert interviews, and validation via survey data, this study uncovers prevalent ecosystem challenges, such as resource fragmentation and regulatory complexity. A model is proposed to enhance collaboration and facilitate efficient resource-sharing across ecosystem actors. This approach provides a structured framework for incubators and startups to address funding, mentorship, and regulatory compliance gaps. Future research should explore real-world applications of this model to validate its effectiveness in diverse settings, ultimately advancing the MedTech ecosystem and improving support structures for startups.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis focuses on the development and evaluation of Cu-based coatings, specifically CuNiIn and self-lubricating CuNiIn/MoS₂ composites, fabricated using low-temperature thermal spray techniques. High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF), High Velocity Air-Fuel (HVAF), and Inner Diameter High Velocity Air-Fuel (ID-HVAF) processes were employed to deposit dense, low-porosity coatings aimed at improving tribological performance and reducing oxidation during fabrication.
Comprehensive microstructural and phase characterizations were performed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) to analyze surface and cross-sectional morphologies, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to identify phase composition, and Raman Spectroscopy to confirm the integrity and distribution of MoS₂ in the composite coatings. Mechanical properties were evaluated through Vickers microhardness testing, and the tribological behavior of the coatings was systematically assessed using high-temperature reciprocating sliding wear tests at room temperature and 450 °C, simulating demanding service conditions.
The results revealed that coatings produced by HVAF and ID-HVAF exhibited significantly lower porosity and oxide content compared to HVOF, leading to improved mechanical integrity and wear resistance. The incorporation of MoS₂ as a solid lubricant within the CuNiIn matrix resulted in a substantial reduction in friction coefficient and wear rate, particularly at elevated temperatures, due to the formation of stable tribofilms and transfer layers at the sliding interface.
This study demonstrates the potential of HVAF-sprayed self-lubricating CuNiIn/MoS₂ composite coatings as high-performance solutions for aerospace and industrial components subjected to fretting and sliding wear. The findings contribute to the advancement of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient surface engineering technologies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>When the Maiden Becomes Death: Contemplating the Monstrous Girl in the Fairy Tale Reimaginings of Angela Carter and Helen Oyeyemi</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Fusaro, Crista</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>When Helen Oyeyemi’s wicked stepmother, Boy, shows her friend her nightmarish engagement gift from her husband-to-be—a handcrafted bracelet of a white-gold snake whose body wraps around the length of Boy’s forearm—her friend replies: “I mean, could that scream ‘wicked stepmother’ any louder?” (110). Boy’s bracelet foreshadows her fate as the wicked stepmother, but her evilness is equivocal: she exiles one daughter to protect another. Angela Carter’s Snow White seems to become somewhat monstrous, too, after she is violently assaulted. When Angela Carter and Helen Oyeyemi retell a fairy tale, they reject the black-and-white lens that the conventional fairy tale is told through. Both writers unsettle the fairy tale tradition by unearthing and exposing the darker meanings that remain buried in these original tales. I argue that it is most notably through the figure of the monstrous girl that Carter and Oyeyemi foreground the patriarchal and misogynist politics that the fairy tale encodes yet overlooks. Carter and Oyeyemi, in their respective “Snow White” and “Sleeping Beauty” retellings, turn the familiar character of the innocent girl monstrous to emphasize what it means to be monstrous—and that to be monstrous is not a simple question of being virtuous or cruel, good or bad. Carter’s and Oyeyemi’s female monsters are complex, and I further examine how their actions originate from a desire to attain agency over their bodies. When Carter and Oyeyemi retell a fairy tale, they do not complicate the fairy tale but rather reveal that it is already intricate, filled with hidden messages.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Statistical Analysis of Energy Measures as Biomarkers of SARS-Covid-2 Variants and Receptors

Khawla Ghannoum Al Chawaf

The COVID-19 outbreak has made it evident that the nature and behavior of SARS-CoV-2 require constant research and surveillance, owing to the high mutation rates that lead to variants. This work focuses on the statistical analysis of energy measures as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, three statistical tests are applied to the data: the multiple ANOVA test for equality of means, Bartlett’s test for equality of variances, and Levene’s test for assessing the homogeneity of variances. These tests aim to determine which energy measure can differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 variants, human cell receptors (GRP78 and ACE2), and their combinations.
To further investigate the specific pairwise differences between groups, Tukey’s HSD test was performed after the ANOVA. The Tukey test provided adjusted p-values (p-adj) for each pairwise comparison, allowing for a more detailed understanding of significant differences in energy measures across variants, receptors, and their combinations.
The proposed approach combines energy measures and sequence data to develop classification systems and brings out the variety of the virus’ genetics and interaction mechanisms. This work aims to improve the accuracy of variant identification and contribute to creating tailored interventions, which would help address the COVID-19 issue and contribute considerably to the global fight against the pandemic.

        <etd_ms:title>The Power Politics of Regional Deindustrialization: The Cape Breton Development Corporation, State Ownership, and Pit Closure in Canada’s Coal Industry 1967-2001</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO) was an ambitious attempt by the Canadian federal government to manage the deindustrialization of coal mining on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Created in 1967 by nationalizing the unprofitable collieries, DEVCO’s original mission was to incrementally close them, while fostering an alternative economic base in the area. The mines operated until 2001 when they finally closed. DEVCO has primarily been studied as an example of federal regional development policy, as it experimented with many projects to stimulate economic growth. However, DEVCO’s Coal Division has remained almost entirely unstudied, despite much more money, and outliving the regional development programs. Not only that, managed wind-down was quickly abandoned, and from 1973 the Coal Division expanded, a process that continued into the 1980s. In this thesis I argue that the Coal Division’s history significantly modifies our understanding of DEVCO, as regional development was only one factor in the crown corporation’s trajectory. Those other factors mostly related to coal, which the Canadian state was deeply entangled with through energy policy, labour relations, and political patronage. Furthermore, as a state-owned enterprise, DEVCO had key differences from private sector deindustrialization, as this formally politicized pit closure and made governments vulnerable to pressure from those most impacted. DEVCO was a unique response to deindustrialization, which has some enduring implications for fossil fuel infrastructures today.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>When Noise Helps: From Impossibility to Approximate Impossibility in Identity Effects for Deep Learning</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Glickman, Paul</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Artificial intelligence, and especially deep learning, have had a major spotlight shined on them in recent years. Our goal is to mathematically and computationally explore some of its potential limits - specifically, those related to identity effects and generalization. Identity effects refer to the ability to recognize specific patterns, such as checking whether two sounds are identical, something human brains are very adept at handling from a very young age. It has been observed that depending on how the input data is ``encoded”, that is what type of vectors differentiate the pair of objects to be classified a deep neural net might fail to generalize identity effects outside the training set. Namely, given that matching objects are valid pairs, and non-matching objects are not, some types of encodings will allow the network to generalize to inputs it has never seen before, and some will not. Previous research shows that the existence of a specific orthogonal transformation on the encodings can predict impossibility of generalization. We explore mathematically and then test numerically whether approximate orthogonality leads to predictable loosening of the impossibility, eventually finding that approximate orthogonality leads to approximate impossibility. In particular, adding random noise to traditional encodings such as the ``one-hot'' encoding can help neural networks generalize outside the training set.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Blood flow restriction (BFR) training, a technique combining low intensity exercise with blood flow occlusion, has been shown to be safe and effective in eliciting gains in muscle mass and strength across multiple populations including athletes and rehabilitating individuals. Benefits such as producing less muscle damage leading to faster recovery after training and the deterrence of muscular atrophy after surgery have made this an increasingly popular technique. Currently, much of the literature has probed the long-term effects of BFR on the human body, often testing participants over a few weeks or months. Despite this, little is still known about the immediate effects of BFR. A study was conducted to examine the acute effects of BFR on a young and healthy population. Chapter 1 provides theoretical context to this project and examines the current literature. Chapter 2 describes the study that was conducted to gain greater insight into the acute effects of BFR training, specifically looking at the effects on vasodilation, blood flow and muscle oxygenation. Lastly, chapter 3 includes a conclusion and future research directions.</etd_ms:description>

This study used qualitative data from a focus group with three faculty members in higher education who taught online to address the following research questions:
1.	How do faculty members in higher education describe Universal Design for Learning (UDL) in courses online?
2.	How do faculty members in higher education describe adding UDL in their courses online?
3.	What challenges do faculty members in higher education encounter when it comes to UDL?
4.	How do faculty members in higher education describe UDL-related resources?

The literature review explored key concepts and past studies on online learning formats and the common technological challenges faced by faculty. It also examined Universal Design for Learning (UDL), developed by CAST, which includes the principles of Engagement, Representation, and Action &amp; Expression for accessible, inclusive learning. Key terms explored included Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI), Self-Determination Theory (SDT), and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to fill a gap in the literature.

Findings showed that consistent with existent research, faculty members apply UDL strategies, especially Action &amp; Expression, without formal training or awareness. Participants expressed a need for clearer institutional guidance and discipline-specific support to implement UDL more effectively. The study resulted in a proposed model for UDL support at the macro and micro levels using EDI, SDT, and WCAG in tandem with UDL.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Effects of Natural Disasters on Firm Performance: Exploring the Moderating Effects of Gender Diversification</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Natural disasters pose significant challenges to all businesses and firms, disrupting operations, profitability, and overall performance. Many researchers and business professionals link a firm's ability to recover and maintain stability in these events to its governance structures including the gender diversity of its leadership positions. While numerous studies have examined the relationship between governance structure and Corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures, our research extends the existing literature by investigating the moderating role of gender diversification within governance structures and CSR disclosures on firm performance. Specifically, we focus on the resilience management demonstrated by female leaders in response to external shocks caused by natural disasters. Our analysis is based on a dataset of 5,185 U.S. firms spanning the period from 2000 to 2021. We draw firm-level data from Compustat and Boardex accessed through Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) and obtain information on natural disaster damages from the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS). We adopt a dual-method approach, combining the fixed effects model with the period seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method to address heteroskedasticity. Our findings reveal that while gender diversification is not a primary determinant in mitigating the economic impact of natural disasters on operational performance, firms with greater gender diversity exhibit improved performance, particularly in response to human-centric shocks. We conclude that gender-diverse firms are better equipped to manage risks, demonstrate stronger resilience, and sustain a positive reputation, all of which contribute to enhanced firm performance and value.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Why Relational Facts need to be at least as Primitive as
Monadic Facts</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Hamouth, Dax Avery</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The problem of relations has turned on the question of whether or not relations are real “things” (in the same sense as “objects are things”). This is a mistake and has been the reason so little has been accomplished in the discourse about how to deal with relational sentences and relational facts. I claim instead we should be concerned with the facts which make relational sentences true, and whether those facts are primitively relational, insofar as they cannot be analysed into non-relational, monadic facts. With this claim defended, I argue that it becomes clear that some facts must be primitive relational facts.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Menstruation Beyond “Womanhood”: Understanding and Inscribing Queer Experiences of Menstruation in Montreal</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Iossel, Yana</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis problematizes the assumption that menstruation is exclusively a woman's issue. Inspired by my own personal discomfort around menstruation, the question this research seeks to answer is “how do queer— more specifically, trans and non-binary—individuals in Montreal experience and talk about menstruation?” To address this question, I detail the menstrual experiences of three nonbinary individuals, one transgender man, and one transgender woman. I engage with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to interpret their accounts. The method was developed by Jonathan A. Smith, Paul Flowers, and Michael Larkin (2009) to understand life experiences and embodied phenomena through a rigorous engagement with participants’ narratives. The method has been adapted for anthropological use in the current thesis and has been used in conjunction with a digital ethnography of Instagram and TikTok to analyze how menstruation is discussed on social media platforms. The most significant theme that emerged from data analysis is that neoliberal policies and bio-power influence how transgender and nonbinary people experience menstruation. Some participants experience the effects firsthand when trying to access medical care, while others feel it more discretely in the ways that menstrual products are marketed. This theme is explored at length in the thesis’ third chapter but runs as an undercurrent throughout the rest of the chapters. This thesis contributes to research on trans and nonbinary experiences of menstruation and aims to promote an understanding of menstruation outside of womanhood. I conclude that menstruation is a gender-neutral bodily function and should be understood as such.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Those in the Somali and larger Black Diaspora in Canada have learned to navigate this liminal space where we negotiate our cultural identity and expression to fit into white hegemonic society. This practice is known as code switching. This ability to adapt and fit into various settings and situations while still holding on to your culture is often seen as a superpower in the Black Diaspora, but it is also a heavy burden. Code switching is the need to conform and express oneself in a palatable way in colonialist societies. In my research I explore how concepts like the Technovocalic Body, Black technopoetics, sonic substance, and Toloobid might create an alternative way of self expression that allow for those in the Black Diasporic to speak and literally feel their ineffable thoughts and emotions while reaffirming their cultural identity. This project utilizes research-creation to create a wearable interactive sound art piece, the Burur Device, that allows a person to haptically engage with affectively charged sonic media and respond to it by distorting it and imbuing it with their own feelings. The Burur Device was created by attending Somali cultural events and engaging with the sound recordings of these to recreate a sonic space to inhabit, feel and distort. The immersions and immediacy of interactive haptic sound capabilities of the Burur Device offer a way for those in the Black Diaspora to express, materialize and embody the ineffable pressures of code switching that alludes language (for now).</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring Songwriting as an Expression of Grief on Cape Breton Island: 
A Qualitative Interview Study</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jackson, Meaghan</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Grief, bereavement, music therapy, songwriting, Cape Breton Island</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Located in Nova Scotia, Canada, Cape Breton Island has a rich and diverse musical history, which includes a well known tradition of using songwriting as a mourning practice. In the cultural mosaic of Canada, individuals seeking music therapy bring unique and diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. Exploring these inherent cultural practices can offer models for integrating songwriting into the bereavement music therapy session while also informing music therapy training programs and future research. Grounded in a social constructivist epistemology (Hillier, 2016) and using qualitative semi-structured interviews, this study explored the use of songwriting as an expression of grief for three Cape Breton Island songwriters. Utilizing inductive thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006), three themes emerged from the data. The first theme, transformative grief journey, reflects how participants experienced personal growth while moving through a unique journey through their grief. Songwriting helped them process a range of emotional responses, provided a safe outlet for difficult feelings, and supported their ability to move forward. The second theme, cultivating connection, highlights how songwriting reduced feelings of isolation and helped participants feel connected to others through sharing their music. The third theme, intrinsic practice, describes how participants trusted the songwriting process and emphasized its cultural importance as an inherent and meaningful way to express grief.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>“sad girlies how are we doing rn??”: Queer Youth’s Affective Engagements with ‘Sad Girl Music’ on TikTok</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jamet-Lange, Hannah</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>queer youth, TikTok, affect, fandom, music, mental health</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>In recent years, TikTok has regularly been flooded with videos of mostly young queer women engaging with so-called ‘sad girl music’: a contested term referring to music that explores ‘ordinary’ sad feelings. This thesis examines sad girl music in the platform context, focusing on how identity constructions, emotions, and especially sadness, are mobilized in queer youths’ engagements with the music on TikTok. Drawing on affect theory, political economy, and fandom studies, I conduct a critical discourse analysis of 222 TikToks collected using the platform’s sound feature. My findings indicate that, in a context where the platformization of music is increasingly shaping discourses around music and emphasizing identity and mood as central to music consumption, TikTok facilitates new avenues for identity-construction and community-formation for young queer people in fandom spaces who utilize the platform’s affordances to subvert and queer mainstream trends and fandom practices. I further show how engagements with sad girl music reveal queer youths’ disillusionment with a future they are nonetheless continuing to yearn for. Expressions of sadness thus function as a way for queer youth to understand and process their sadness within broader socio-political contexts, allowing them to connect with others and potentially transform the inertia of waiting into political action. This thesis contributes to understandings of how queer fandom practices make use of and are (re)shaped by the TikTok platform, as well as understandings of the role of emotions in platformed music fandoms where collective experiences of sadness and shared affective investments can facilitate engagements with politics.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Beyond European Extractive Modernism: Appropriations of West- and Central-African Cultural Belongings in Paul-Émile Borduas' 1942 Gouaches</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Janssen, Alexis</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Québec art; Paul-Émile Borduas; African art; Extractive Modernism</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis argues that the celebrated Québécois modernist Paul-Émile Borduas (1905-1960) appropriated West- and Central-African cultural belongings in five of his 1942 gouaches. Through popular literature including the surrealist magazine Minotaure, and exhibitions spaces such as the Musée d'ethnographie du Trocadéro and the Paul Guillaume Gallery in Paris, and the Exposition missionnaire and McGill Museums in Montréal, Borduas encountered the African cultural belongings he would eventually appropriate. The artist likely sought out these points of contact as a way to feed his interest in global Indigenous cultures. Using a post- and anti-colonial approach, this thesis highlights how influential literary and museological colonial channels were on the artist. The extractive nature of these channels places Borduas within a tradition of "extractive Modernism," pervasive in early twentieth-century European Modernism. While he was made aware of African cultural belongings in Paris, Borduas also took an interest in European art and likely adopted extractive Modernism as a way to assert his independence and originality in war time Québec. As well as engaging with global colonialisms, Borduas' appropriations can be placed in dialogue with local colonial legacies in Montréal. This thesis concludes that some of Borduas' 1942 gouaches are doubly transnational: first as they appropriate West- and Central African cultural belongings, and second as they inherit from European extractive Modernism. By placing Borduas at the intersection of these two themes, this thesis places Québec art history within global dynamics of colonialism.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Foreign Direct Investment Incentive Strategy in a
Limited Resource Setting</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Jendi, Abdul Razak</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This paper explores incentive strategies that regions use to attract foreign direct investment
(FDI) amid resource constraints and competition. It analyzes how regions can effectively allocate
limited resources to enhance FDI incentives, focusing on financial aspects such as tax
rates, corruption, and the overall investment climate.
Using theoretical scenarios, the paper identifies successful strategies for incentivizing FDI,
taking into account priority sectors, proximity to competing regions, and level of information
available. The findings reveal that distant regions should always act based on their true preference
while regions within commutable distance should strategize based on the other region’s
interest, incentive package, and level of information available.
Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of managing limited resources and aligning
incentives with regional strengths. It also discusses reasons why regions may opt not to
incentivize certain projects despite their interest when full information is available and regions
are within commutable distance. This research contributes valuable insights on optimizing resource
allocation for attracting FDI and suggests areas for future investigation regarding the
long-term impacts of various incentive types on regional development.

        <etd_ms:title>Identifying and Analyzing False Information Discourses: A Text Mining Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets in 2020</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Kaddoura, Mohamad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>False information is an ongoing challenge to global health crises that influences public perception and weakens emergency response efforts. This study investigates how false information is structured and framed during pandemics by using COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Focusing on COVID-19 related Twitter posts, our study filters tweets that possibly contain false information and groups them into conversations that are analyzed through two of the main topic modeling techniques: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The results of NMF, which was found to discover more coherent and interpretable topics, were considered for theme identification and framing analysis. We were able to identify eight dominant themes that shaped the entire COVID-19 narratives. These narratives were highly politicized, but also included themes like severity, virus origin, potential treatments, health measures and global responses. The framing analysis showed that linguistic characteristics across false information often included emotionally charged words and evolved through different political and social contexts. Frames like blaming, resistance and conspiracy were recurring across the identified themes, indicating mixed feelings that amplified the spread of false information and challenged public health efforts in combating the pandemic. By combining topic modeling with manual interpretation, this research presents a novel approach to understanding the context of false information and its dynamics during times of health crises. Our findings contribute to the studies of false information and crisis communication research by showing how narratives are framed and how they evolve over time.

        <etd_ms:title>Exploring the Dynamics of Occupants’ Thermal and Visual Perception, Physiological Responses, and Performance in Office Environments</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>Understanding occupant comfort in indoor environments is critical for designing spaces that promote well-being and efficiency. However, traditional assumptions regarding occupants’ thermal and visual preferences often result in energy inefficiency or discomfort. This thesis examines different approaches for acquiring occupant information—ranging from subjective feedback and physiological measurements—to better understand comfort preferences in varying environments. 
Additionally, this work addresses the gaps in comfort research, which is predominantly focused on the Global North, by conducting experimental studies in contrasting climatic regions (Montreal, Canada - ASHRAE Climate Zone 6, and Cairo, Egypt - ASHRAE Climate Zone 2B). These studies investigate the interplay between thermal and visual comfort domains under varied lighting and temperature conditions and their impact on physiological responses such as heart rate variability (HRV) and skin temperature (ST). Furthermore, thermal comfort analyses were conducted using wearable sensing technologies to monitor physiological signals, including electroencephalography (EEG), HRV, and ST. These analyses assess how thermal conditions influence comfort perceptions and task performance across different genders and locations, revealing significant variations in physiological responses to temperature and lighting conditions. The experiments were conducted in controlled office environments to simulate real-world conditions, and the data collected aimed to evaluate location-specific and gender-related differences in comfort and performance.
Comparative analyses from experimental trials in Montreal and Cairo show notable differences in thermal comfort perception and task performance, with males being more sensitive to thermal conditions and location-specific variations affecting heart rate variability and skin temperature. These findings provide a foundation for developing adaptive building environments that can dynamically adjust indoor conditions to improve occupant well-being and energy efficiency.
These findings offer valuable insights into the relationship between physiological responses, thermal comfort perceptions, and occupant performance in office environments, offering a pathway toward the integration of Occupant-Centric Control (OCC) strategies in future smart building environment.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Automated Window-to-Wall Ratio Estimation Using Google 3D Map Tiles Analysis and AI</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) is a critical parameter in architecture and urban planning, influencing energy efficiency, daylighting, and thermal performance. Traditionally, WWR is either manually measured or obtained from architectural plans, but these methods are impractical for large-scale studies due to data unavailability. Recent advances in machine learning and 3D mapping offer new opportunities for automation. In this work, we propose an automated method to estimate WWR by extracting 3D building meshes from Google 3D Maps and using a machine learning model to segment windows and walls from their images. We utilize Google 3D Maps for 3D building model extraction and images, OpenStreetMap (OSM) for defining building boundaries, and a UNet-based deep learning model to segment windows, walls, roofs, and other elements. The UNet model, trained on 1,000 manually labeled building images, accurately segments windows and walls, from which WWR is calculated. Unlike previous methods relying on facade images, drone surveys, or street-level views, our approach leverages Google’s pre-existing 3D city data, available for over 2,500 cities worldwide, offering a scalable, effective, and cost-efficient solution. The AI-predicted WWR values are validated by comparing them with manual measurements from actual buildings, confirming the method’s accuracy. This research advances the automation of architectural and energy analysis, providing a fast, cost-effective, machine learning-driven tool for WWR estimation. Future work includes enhancing model robustness, incorporating larger datasets, and exploring additional 3D data sources.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines the thirty-year installation and sculpture practice of New York-based artist Portia Munson (b. 1961, Beverly, MA) involving the collection and assemblage of discarded plastic objects of the same colour, specifically the Pink Project series. While her assemblage works of blue and green plastic trash present more obvious ties to plastic consumption and its detrimental impact on the environment, the Pink Projects series reveals the scale of the pink palette of products that become consumer waste, and enables an understanding of both the work’s subject and materiality as the abject product of gendered capitalist ideology. I consider four of Munson’s works that assemble pink plastic waste. This thesis argues that Munson’s work critically visualizes the paralyzing, overwhelming, and terrifying nature of our planetary predicament, while also enacting a feminist reparative ritual —  drawing from the history of women’s altar-making, a feminist history of capitalism, eco-criticism, anti-capitalist philosophies, and depression studies. The transformative quality of Munson’s works hinge on their expression of the degraded and abject status–produced in the transition to and maintenance of capitalism–of waste and female body as productive spaces through which the unknown may be encountered and therefore from which the critical vernacular to address planetary chaos is produced.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This study focuses on the cultural construction of oil in the United States that occurred during the Great Depression to reexamine accepted historical narratives on race, class, and gender. Though it is present in thousands of products and represented in countless visual forms that we buy and see today, oil has paradoxically become a difficult thing to grasp and concept to represent historically; oil is both physical substance and social material that has defied adequate materialization in scholarship. Of particular interest to this study are the intersections between the symbolic economy surrounding oil use and automobile culture, and how both reflected a particular discourse that defined “American ways of life” and who was deserving of it. Critically, this study examines how automobile ownership and automobility reconfigured particular middle-class imaginaries during the 1930s. A discursive analysis of print advertisements from this time, therefore, provides unique historical insight into the peculiarities of middle-class American lifestyles developed by and premised on the combustion of oil (petroculture), and why today many Americans are loathe to disentangle themselves and their definitions of life from it. Chapter one explores the development of American consumer culture during the early twentieth century that normalized the centrality of oil in human life. Chapter two discusses how and why New Deal policies created societal institutions to provide Americans with “modern” standards of living premised on the mass consumption of oil. Chapter three analyzes how automobile advertisements became the single largest factor promoting petro-capital life in which social, gendered, and racial division were (re)produced and legitimated via acts of oil consumption and the exercise of class power. In so doing, automobile advertisements re-envisioned the aesthetics of life through representations of mobility, freedom, distinction, and modernity; the most prominent fantasies within white, middle-class consumer society mediated and enabled by oil energy.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The destruction in my native Ukraine intensified my need to critically and meaningfully locate the sense of self in relation to the world and the groundbreaking events surrounding the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, alongside my role as an art educator in fostering peaceful and inclusive educational environments. I turned to Global Citizenship theory and explored the globality of forced migration and the issue of war by considering the migrant identity of a global citizen from my local perspective as a Ukrainian immigrant, as well as that of Ukrainian refugees in Montreal, Canada. My main question was how selected Ukrainian refugees experience identity, belonging, and difference beyond the traditional binary and exclusionary perspectives on migration. To understand their experiences, I investigated the notion of worldmaking denizen proposed by the postmigrant analytical perspective while applying narrative inquiry methods coupled with the artistic lens of Ukrainian vernacular art, particularly Petrykivka painting. This approach facilitated a nuanced and meaningful understanding of the participants’ experiences as a transversal dialogue across differences and antagonisms. The understanding guided me in conceptualizing my globally oriented professional position through a hybrid confabulation of motif-motive—an inclusive and relational representational system that encompasses art, citizenship, and the significance of individual and community action in shaping the future.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis considers the ways in which artist Senga Nengudi’s R.S.V.P. series (1975-ongoing) occupies museum collections presently and how the works’ material conditions affect conservation processes. Further, this thesis seeks to understand Nengudi’s R.S.V.P. series as an unruly and rebellious form of cultural invention and intervention in the museum. R.S.V.P. is a series of sculptural and performative artworks that utilise worn, nylon pantyhose filled with sand to create bulbous, bodily forms, tautly pinned and stretched across the gallery walls or resting weighty upon the gallery floor. Bringing together interdisciplinary research, this thesis contends with the work’s materiality of pantyhose, sand, and its connection to skin, tactility, and the Black body to address the ongoing acquisition and conservation of R.S.V.P. within museums. As artworks that are ephemeral, tactile, and performative, they possess sensorial and haptic qualities that rebel against museological systems. By drawing on Black studies, contemporary conservation theories, and performance studies, this thesis calls for an ethics of care in attending to R.S.V.P. within a museological collection. Ultimately, it proposes that R.S.V.P. has the potential to redirect conservation processes away from traditional methods predicated on restoration and authenticity, urging institutions to engage with works in ways that meaningfully attend to their material and conceptual complexities.</etd_ms:description>

While magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard in diagnosing soft tissue injuries, magnetic resonance imaging is expensive, difficult to access, and requires a qualified professional. Infrared thermography is a novel technology that is quick, non-invasive, easily accessible, and can provide a static or dynamic image. This study evaluated the use of infrared imaging as a tool to monitor the healing and rehabilitation of injured professional football athletes. The first objective was to use infrared thermography to track changes in average maximum temperature of the injured limb following an injury up until return to play. The second objective was to use infrared thermography to track the average temperature asymmetry between the injured limb and the healthy limb after injury up until return to play. The third objective was to identify the relationships between average maximum temperature, average temperature asymmetry, and LEFS scores at time of injury and return to play in football players recovering from an acute lower extremity musculoskeletal injury. Infrared imaging could measure the changes in temperature from acute inflammation all the way to increased blood flow during sport specific rehabilitation. Infrared imaging can be provided by any health care professional at any time and could improve player safety in the CFL.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>"Our Memory Shall be a Blessing": Constructing and Philanthropizing the Legacy of Robert F. Kennedy</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Langdon, Nia</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Since his death in 1968, popular works and recollections about Senator Robert F. Kennedy have all told a similar story: that Kennedy was a singular politician with a special connection to underdogs, and that when he died, the nation collectively mourned, for there was something redeeming about America’s future that died with him. The context and production of this narrative has thus far remained largely unchallenged, which has allowed the proliferation of an incomplete story. I argue here that this popular conception of Kennedy’s legacy was heavily informed and mediated by his friends and family in the public mourning practices they organized following Kennedy’s death. This resulted in the formation of a legacy that was flattering to Kennedy’s memory. This constructed legacy was lucrative: it was used to create the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, which both structured itself around and reinforced Kennedy’s legacy in order to engage in philanthropic endeavours. The RFK Memorial ensured the continuance of its namesake’s legacy – but it also directly contradicted this legacy’s central principles by enacting programs which were funded by architects of the ongoing War on Crime. Studying this process is crucial to understanding how liberalism and liberal institutions also contributed to the War on Crime, and how the memory of liberal figures can be co-opted to enact programs that are directly antithetical to their works in life.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Larochelle, Olyvier</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study explores the effect of gamification on behavioural engagement and looks at the practicality of implementing game elements into classrooms from the teacher's perspective. The aim of this study was to explore if two game elements, narrative and choice, could be used in a classroom environment without increasing teachers' load while also behaviourally engaging students.
The two main research questions were: a) What impact do specific game elements (narrative and choice) have on the behavioural engagement of elementary school students in an ESL classroom setting? and b) What are the practical challenges and benefits of integrating game elements into elementary school teachers’ instructional strategies?
The teacher used gamified activities and scenarios to teach her regular classroom while the students participated in the activities. The activities were integrated into each class to be as inclusive of the material as possible, with a minimal amount of disruption. The participants were observed throughout each class and completed a questionnaire. Students and teachers had different questions, each targeting a different research question.
The students generally liked the activities, but the results were inconclusive regarding a change in their behavioural engagement. The biggest indicator of changes in the students' behavioural engagement was switching from structured to non-structured activities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>“I Love (Monster) Girls” is a hybrid-poetic exploration of monstrosity as an escape from queer trauma, disability, and grief. The project has two primary components; (1) autofiction as ‘Syd’ seeks therapy for their slew of tumultuous relations and suicidal ideation; and (2) prose, lyric, and film script that explore Syd’s explosive and occasionally violent relationship with the shapeshifting Monster Girl that they find in their apartment wall. These two components shift between real world experiences and a highly fantastical look at self-loathing, anxiety, anger, hypersexuality and isolation. The project is inspired by
other contemporary texts such as Ariana Reines’ Coeur de Lion and Carmen Maria Machado’s In the Dream House, that also seek to comprehend heartbreak and violence through an author-forward perspective, and by monstrously queer media such as Psycho Nymph Exile by Porpentine Charity Heartscape, the film Ex Machina directed by Alex Garland or the graphic novel Layers of White by solopipb, all of which explore sexual and often violent relationships with monsters.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Time Out of Joint: Hauntology, Nostalgia, and Inter-Artistic Longing in Joanna Newsom's The Milk-Eyed Mender and Frank Ocean's Blonde</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lemay, Maude</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores the spectral presence of the past in contemporary music through the lens of hauntology, focusing on Joanna Newsom's The Milk-Eyed Mender (2004) and Frank Ocean's Blonde (2016). While contemporary music is often shaped by nostalgia, hauntology offers a nuanced framework—one that captures the past's stubborn refusal to fully disappear, disrupting linear time and unsettling our sense of the present. Drawing on Jacques Derrida and Mark Fisher, I explore how these albums engage with hauntological aesthetics not only through sonic elements but also through their lyrics. While Fisher primarily developed hauntology in music as a sonic concept, I argue that lyrical elements can equally contribute to its effect. What this thesis specifically suggests is that inter-artistic longing—tensions between different artistic mediums within the lyrics—creates a hauntological quality. In Newsom's work, literary intertextuality generates a tension between literature and music, while Ocean's fragmented, cinematic narratives blur the boundaries between music and film. By analyzing these inter-artistic tensions, this thesis demonstrates how Newsom's and Ocean's lyricism evokes a spectral past that remains both familiar and elusive. Situating these albums within broader cultural and political contexts, I demonstrate how hauntology in lyric-driven music reflects unresolved personal and collective histories, as well as shifting cultural landscapes in the United States from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Shaped by Society: Uncovering the Sociological Factors Behind the Development of Serial Killers</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Lfarouk, Fatine</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Serial killing is one of the most extreme and rare forms of deviant behaviour, but much of the existing research remains focused on psychological and criminological explanations. This critical literature review examines serial murder through a sociological lens, identifying key risk factors that contribute to the development and actions of serial killers. By emphasizing broader social, environmental, and structural influences, this essay challenges the notion that serial murder is solely an individual pathology. It explores how factors such as childhood abuse, dysfunctional family dynamics, socio-economic marginalization, media influence, and violent subcultures interact to shape serial killers’ trajectories. The analysis draws on both positivist and social constructionist perspectives. Findings indicate that childhood trauma, particularly abuse, is a recurring risk factor among serial killers, though not a universal one. Additionally, media portrayals can contribute to the construction of serial killers as cultural figures, influencing both public perception and offenders’ self-identities. Contrary to popular belief, socio-economic status alone does not appear to be a primary determinant of serial murder. By synthesizing various sociological perspectives, this review highlights the intersection of social forces that contribute to serial killing, positioning it as a product of broader structural and cultural dynamics within society rather than an isolated phenomenon.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Forecasting Change: Climate Connections in Canadian Extreme Weather Reporting</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Losinger-Ross, Brianna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Canadians from coast to coast are experiencing the consequences of the increase in extreme weather events, like the unprecedented 2023 forest fire season. With the impact these extreme events have on public life, the Canadian media cover them extensively, and thus they make up a significant proportion of the news as they occur. The number of these events is said to continue increasing, as the scientific consensus states climate change and rising temperatures will continue to influence the frequency and intensity of extreme weather. In recent years, scientists have begun conducting extreme event attribution (EEA) studies which link certain events to climate change. While some argue that journalists should mention these EEA studies in their coverage, others argue making explicit connections to climate change is enough to fully inform the public. Even with this newly emerging debate, little is known about how the Canadian media mention or connect climate change to extreme weather events. Using a text as data approach, with automated content analysis, this thesis explores how five Canadian media outlets cover four types of extreme weather events, by comparing reporting from 2019 and 2023. This work aims to examine how the media mention climate change, whether they connect extreme weather events to climate, and how they make that connection. The results show that overall, the proportion of climate connection used in the coverage of extreme events by the selected Canadian media increased from 2019 to 2023. Additionally, both the proportion of climate mentions and connections are greater than those found in existing studies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Deep learning-based 3D semantic segmentation requires a large volume of training data to achieve robust generalization and prevent overfitting. However, acquiring extensive 3D datasets remains a significant challenge. This study addresses data scarcity in 3D semantic segmentation by leveraging a 2D projection-based approach, utilizing advancements in 2D segmentation techniques to enhance 3D segmentation performance. The key insight is that while 3D scene availability may be limited, an unlimited number of 2D projections can be generated, which can then be reprojected back into 3D space. This approach enables models to benefit from state-of-the-art 2D segmentation techniques while mitigating information loss during dimensional transformation. This study evaluates widely used 2D projection techniques, including spherical projection, bird’s-eye view, and perspective projection, to convert 3D data into the 2D domain. 2D CNN-based segmentation models, such as U-Net and SegFormer, are then applied to generate predictions, which are subsequently reprojected into the 3D domain for final segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that using data from only a single area in the S3DIS dataset, our 2D projection-based method achieves a 3D IoU score of 47.21%. Moreover, when using a 1:1 train-test ratio on similar rooms, 3D IoU of 56.23% is achieved, highlighting that even with limited data, projection-based approaches offer a viable and effective solution for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Somewhere in Mérida is a collection of interwoven short stories set in the Mexican town of Mérida and centered on a young woman’s upcoming wedding. The collection attempts to explore the ways in which women betray parts of themselves to fit into what is expected of them, and what it takes to break away from those expectations. Each piece focuses on a different female character trying to navigate a challenging relationship, romantic or otherwise, and having to decide what kind of life she wants to lead. From young queer love to the grief of losing one’s life partner, these stories touch on themes of attraction, loneliness, and immigration.</etd_ms:description>

framework based on successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed, achieving up to a 20.3% improvement in network sum rate. Additionally, to simplify real-time decision-making, a deep
reinforcement learning model using an actor-critic architecture is proposed, reducing computational time by 98% compared to the SCA method.
The second part explores the effects of a movable antenna (MA)-assisted jammer in a downlink MISO system. The analysis shows that MA-based jamming causes a 30% reduction in sum rate and a 25% increase in outage probability compared to fixed antenna setups. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of RIS as a countermeasure against such adversarial attacks under different levels of jammer knowledge. Safeguarding RIS channel state information is found to be critical, as its compromise renders the system ineffective.
Overall, this research provides a comprehensive framework for utilizing RIS to enhance communication performance and strengthen security in wireless environments, laying the foundation for robust next-generation networks.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>What’s in a ne? Variable ne Deletion in the Spoken French of Two Canadian Politicians: François Legault and Justin Trudeau
Megan Magisano
The French language in Quebec is deeply rooted in the province’s francophone culture and identity (Oakes, 2004); consequently, some of its spoken features diverge from varieties spoken in Europe. One of these features is the variable deletion of the negation particle ne (Poplack &amp; St-Amand, 2007; e.g., “je ne parle pas”), which can be variably produced depending on a number of linguistic and social factors.
This study investigated whether Quebec French speakers employ variable ne deletion in their speech and the phenomenon’s relationship to sociostylistic contexts (i.e., formal vs. informal styles), hypothesizing that this variable deletion may be connected to expressions of Quebec identity. To test this hypothesis, a variationist analysis was conducted to compare ne deletion in the speech of two prominent political figures in Canada: Justin Trudeau and François Legault. They were selected based on their respective French-Canadian backgrounds and prominence in Canada and Quebec. The corpus used for this analysis was collected and transcribed from a selection of each politician’s political addresses regarding Covid-19. The researchers hypothesized that Legault would be more likely to delete ne than Trudeau, and that Legault would be more likely to delete ne in less formal settings. Following a variationist perspective for examining variable phenomena, an inter-speaker analysis compared ne deletion between speakers (Legault and Trudeau), while an intra-speaker analysis compared ne deletion between sociostylistic contexts (i.e., formal public addresses and informal question-and-answer periods).
iii
Statistical results (Goldvarb Z; Sankoff et al., 2018) revealed that Legault was significantly more likely to delete ne than Trudeau. Additionally, Legault showed no significant difference in the likelihood of ne deletion in the adopted sociostylistic contexts. The patterns observed in Legault’s speech reflect the variationist literature on Quebec French, in that French- Canadians almost categorically favour ne deletion (Poplack &amp; St-Amand, 2007). One possible explanation for these results is that Legault’s frequent use of ne deletion solidifies his link to the Quebec identity, whereas Trudeau’s patterns deviate from the Quebec French norm, perhaps to reinforce his role as a Canadian leader, thus appealing to Canada’s francophone population on a more national level.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Development of pH-responsive hydrogel films encapsulated with PEG-VEGF165 bioconjugates for wound dressings</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Malik, Karuna</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Protein-based wound dressings have emerged as a topic of interest in chronic wound healing owing to their distinct physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Growth factor proteins, such as platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), play a pivotal role in wound healing by mediating angiogenic responses and promoting the formation of new blood vessels, thereby accelerating recovery. However, protein delivery faces several challenges that can be addressed through the bioconjugation of proteins with macromolecules, which enhances their stability, solubility, bioactivity, and half-life. Over the years, various chemical strategies have been developed to conjugate synthetic polymers onto proteins effectively. One such approach is the "grafting to" strategy, which involves the covalent attachment of pre-formed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to target molecules like proteins or other macromolecules. This method improves the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of the target molecules. 
Various formulations including foams, fibers, and hydrogel films have been explored for safe delivery of proteins and protein bioconjugates. Among these, polymeric hydrogel films have gained significant attention due to their non-cytotoxic nature, versatility, biocompatibility, and ability to provide a moist environment conducive to healing.
My MSc research project focuses on developing hydrogel films crosslinked with boronic ester bonds that encapsulate PEG-VEGF165 bioconjugates to promote the healing process in chronic wounds. The bioconjugates were characterized using techniques such as gel electrophoresis and dynamic light scattering. Additionally, hydrogel films were fabricated with biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) crosslinked with tetrahydroxydiboronic (THDB), a diboronic acid crosslinker, ensuring dimensional stability and effective encapsulation of the bioconjugates. These hydrogels degraded in response to acidic and alkali pHs, hydrogen peroxide, and glucose, which could be found in wounds, leading to enhanced release of encapsulated PEG-VEGF bioconjugates.  
These results, combined with antimicrobial properties, suggest that the developed THDB-PVA/bioconjugate crosslinked films possess great potential for designing dermal wound healing systems.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The Soldier’s Dilemma - To Fight or Not to Fight: A Study of World War II Defection Through Soviet Leaflets Targeting Wehrmacht Soldiers</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Malépart, Simon</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>When in 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, Soviet authorities, aware of the Wehrmacht’s initial superiority, hoped they could weaken the enemy by convincing some of their soldiers to defect and surrender. That idea resulted in a large propaganda campaign, whereby the frontlines were flooded with propaganda leaflets, most notably the series titled the ‘Front-Illustrierte für den Deutschen Soldaten.’ For the Soviets, however, defection was not intended to provide a chance for German soldiers to fight alongside the Red Army. Instead, as will be outlined in my analysis of the leaflets in this collection, the Soviets hoped to convince the German forces that Hitler had betrayed them and Germany, and that the best thing they could do to protect their homeland was to voluntarily surrender to the Red Army. To convey these ideas, Soviet propagandists sought to open a rift between the members of the Wehrmacht and the Nazis by pointing out the multiple grievances German soldiers should have had against the Nazi government. Simultaneously, soldiers were told that they could spend the rest of the war, if only they surrendered, in a cozy prisoner of war camp where they might engage in an array of leisure activities, which included everything from playing games to reading books, and partake of services that they would have enjoyed while back home in Germany, such as haircuts and warm baths. The Soviets then hoped that, combined, the grievances pointed out to German soldiers and the appealing alternatives they were offered might convince enough of them to defect and surrender, and that the outcome of the war might be affected positively.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Mangukiya, Omijkumar Pravinbhai</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed Natural Language Processing, yet challenges such as factual inaccuracies and inadequate reasoning over structured data persist. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address these issues by grounding LLMs in external knowledge. However, conventional RAG methods typically treat knowledge sources as unstructured text, overlooking the semantic relationships vital in domains like enterprise data and healthcare. This thesis introduces a Graph-based RAG approach that leverages the structured nature of graph data to enhance both retrieval and response generation by preserving these semantic relationships. The research focuses on developing conversational question answering systems over semantically structured data, specifically targeting JIRA Issues and Knowledge Graphs through two distinct applications. The core innovation lies in maintaining the inherent data relationships during both retrieval and generation phases by employing structured queries and graph traversal techniques. This method not only allows for domain-specific optimization but also demonstrates improved performance and efficiency compared to traditional RAG methods.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Weighted Federated Averaging in Verifying Sensor Reading in Smart Homes to Mitigate Malicious Attacks</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mansouri, Armin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Federated learning (FL) in event verification of smart homes increases the accuracy of any events, e.g., door opening. If the global model in federated learning gets poisoned, the verification of the event for all the participants will potentially decrease. Existing solutions a. Not considering federated learning in event verification and b. They rely on keeping a reference model on the server and comparing the received model with it, magnifying the effect of the benign global model, clustering the received local models on the server to generate multiple global models for each cluster. However, these approaches have multiple limitations, such as privacy issues and the possibility of making the local model unbalanced and consuming the server's resources to generate multiple global models even for the compromised clients in a cluster. In this thesis, with Weighted Federated  Averaging (WFedAvg), we address the previous limitations for defense against malicious clients in federated learning for event verification. By increasing the number of benign local models and lowering the effect of the compromised clients on the server before aggregation of the model, the effects of the benign clients will increase. Furthermore, this approach has two variations, first, being that the received feedback in addition to local models on the server, will be compared with others and cosine similarity will indicate how much similarities they have, which shows the effect of different clients, second variation, which is extended of the existing works, a sample reference model will get stored on the server and in the cases where the benign clients get deviated from the sample model, they will not be considered as malicious, instead, we extend it by clustering the models and measure how far they are from the cluster that has the reference model. Then, based on the similarity of the clients in that cluster, we control the contribution level of those clients. In this way, it would be possible to get to the minimum loss value and higher accuracy much faster, as is shown in the experiment section. Additionally, while we were investigating the IoT chipset for our purpose, we discovered a vulnerability from one of the most famous IoT chipsets that can be an entry point to compromise a client for performing a federated learning attack for sensor verification, which will be discussed.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Reimagining Organizational Learning in the AI Era: A Conceptual Synthesis of Argyris &amp; Schön, March, and Senge</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Maranger, Alexandra P.</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance efficiency and decision-making, a critical question arises: How does AI shape the deeper processes of organizational learning? Drawing on Argyris and Schön’s (1978) distinction between single- and double-loop learning, March’s (1991) exploration-exploitation framework, and Senge’s (1990) systems thinking, this thesis develops a conceptual model that illuminates AI’s potential to both streamline surface-level corrections and catalyze more profound, transformative change.
A literature review spanning human resource development, knowledge management, and organizational behavior reveals that while AI often yields short-term productivity gains, scholars rarely connect these implementations to fundamental learning dynamics such as reflective inquiry, strategic balancing of efficiency and innovation, or system-wide adaptation. Moreover, existing research underscores an array of moderating factors – including leadership style, organizational culture, ethics, and digital maturity – as pivotal in determining whether AI fosters genuine adaptation or merely reinforces existing norms.
By synthesizing classical learning theories with four key AI applications – machine learning/automated decision-making, human-AI collaboration, big data/real-time analytics, and algorithmic feedback – this thesis provides an integrated framework. The model details how AI can facilitate deeper reflection, sustain ambidexterity, and strengthen systemic feedback loops, contingent on contextual moderators and boundary conditions. In so doing, it aims to offer a more holistic lens for scholars and practitioners.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research thesis presents the development and analysis of a novel Mechano-Pneumatic Wheel (MPW) by integrating the strengths of both pneumatic and non-pneumatic wheels. While pneumatic tires provide excellent comfort and traction, they are prone to punctures and require frequent maintenance. In contrast, non-pneumatic tires are durable and require low maintenance but often fall short in ride quality and versatility. The proposed MPW concept bridges this gap by integrating air springs arranged radially within a structural shear band. This study explores several MPW configurations, focusing on different air spring coupling methods, to optimize load sharing and road contact pressure distribution. A quasi-static model was subsequently developed to predict the wheel’s deflection and load-bearing behaviour and validated using Finite Element Analysis and MATLAB simulations. A parametric investigation was conducted to study the influences of important design variables such as air spring size, configuration, and charge pressure on vertical stiffness. Optimization techniques, including genetic algorithms were applied to identify the optimal design parameters, achieving a target vertical stiffness of 190 kN/m while minimizing fluctuations in load distribution. The research study also incorporates a composite shear band which is modeled as a curved Timoshenko beam to improve its performance. A 3 mm reduction in the wheel’s contact patch deflection was achieved with the addition of the shear band. By combining the best features of pneumatic and non-pneumatic wheel technologies, the present research introduces a versatile and innovative wheel concept with promising applications in automotive, aerospace, and off-road mobility.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>First-order optimization methods remain the standard for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by preconditioning the stochastic gradient with a diagonal matrix. Despite the widespread adoption of first-order methods, second-order optimization algorithms often exhibit superior convergence compared to methods like Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited by a significantly higher per-iteration computational cost compared to first-order methods. In this thesis, we present AdaFisher, a novel adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix to adaptively precondition gradients. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between the improved convergence and generalization of second-order methods and the computational efficiency needed for training DNNs. Despite the traditionally slower speed of second-order optimizers, AdaFisher is effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling, exhibiting remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in both accuracy and convergence speed. The

        <etd_ms:title>Deep Transformational Calibration of Soft Embedded Sensors for Soft Surgical Robots</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Masoumi, Navid</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In this thesis, a novel soft sensor calibration method is proposed for minimally invasive surgery (MIS), based on a gelatin-graphite sensor with high compliance and adaptability developed in previous studies. This approach uses convolutional deep learning that accounts for a sensor’s non-linear behavior and reduces noise amplification. This technique offers a smaller minimum detectable force than other approaches and is particularly useful in sensitive surgical scenarios. The sensor’s performance is characterized by its fine resolution (≤1mN) and accurate force estimation, especially for forces below 400 mN of amplitude. The best calibration (Morse) scheme provides high performance, with a Mean Absolute Error of ≤7.9 mN. This work was validated through comparison among other representative studies and offered a path toward future directions for optimizing and implementing soft robotic sensors in minimally invasive surgeries. The application of this sensor can revolutionize surgical procedures and capitalize on the benefits of soft robotics, potentially enhancing precision and reducing trauma in surgeries. Building on the established capabilities of this calibration method, the thesis further explores its integration with the surgical applications. This integration aims to provide surgeons with a tactile sense that mimics natural touch, thereby improving the control and safety of surgeries. Future studies will aim to enhance the sensor’s performance in minimally invasive surgeries by extending the force sensing range through optimization of material properties and structural design, implementing precise micro-fabrication techniques, developing advanced real-time calibration methods, and integrating the sensor into surgical robotics to evaluate its performance in controlled, simulated MIS scenarios where sensor’s accuracy is validated using physical phantoms to mimic endoluminal procedures.</etd_ms:description>

 Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Surgery</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Mazidi, Mohammad</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The integration of haptic feedback into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) has been constrained by challenges in accurately rendering forces while maintaining system stability and safety. Addressing these limitations, this research introduces the Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA), a novel force-rendering method designed to accurately model complex tool-tissue interactions. Building on the Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), NIMA incorporates nonlinear dynamics to enhance the precision and reliability of force feedback systems. The experimental results demonstrate that NIMA achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 ± 0.02 N, representing a 95% reduction in error compared to IMA. Notably, NIMA eliminates haptic ”kickback” by ensuring that no residual force is applied to the user’s hand when releasing the haptic device, significantly improving both user comfort and patient safety. Furthermore, its ability to account for the nonlinearities of tool-tissue interactions allows for high fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across diverse surgical conditions. This research advances the development of robust, high-performance haptic systems, offering a transformative solution to the challenges of force rendering in teleoperated surgical robotics. By providing a realistic and reliable interface for robotic-assisted surgical procedures, NIMA has the potential to enhance surgical precision, optimize patient outcomes, and set new standards for haptic feedback in RAMIS.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>University policies significantly affect university students’ academic lives. Concerningly, students do not engage with university policies even when they are directly provided (Jordan, 2001). This intrinsic case study bricolage employs Critical Pedagogy as its theoretical framework to explore how six students used Question Formulation Technique (QFT’) to engage and interact with their university’s Code of Rights and Responsibilities (the Code’) and each other in two peer groups of three students each in separate sessions. Data sources include participant-generated questions, an observation sheet, and individual post-session questionnaires. Both participant groups had difficulty self-organizing during QFT and engaging with the Code due to a lack of prior knowledge of its terms, structure, and origins. A modified Bloom’s Taxonomy (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001) and a Question Types and Purposes Rubric analyzed the generated questions to determine the questions’ cognitive levels and objectives. Data triangulation revealed that QFT allowed participants to dialogue with each other about the Code, and that most participants recognized their knowledge gaps concerning the Code and expressed intention to use QFT in the future unless they already used a preferred questioning technique. This study recommends providing university students with policy literacy instructional interventions and using QFT as a needs assessment tool.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>McPhail, Ian Seth</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This action research study explores the use of video games in a Freirean culture circle. Video games are a popular media format enjoyed by many that can provide rich opportunities for learning. Following Paulo Freire’s methodology of conscientization, I designed and facilitated a project called Digital Decodings, where a small group of adult learners decoded themes embedded in popular role-playing video games over five weekly sessions. Digital Decodings was an educational space where frameworks shifted, conscientization deepened, and participants were exposed to new ways of thinking. Working with video games provided unique decoding opportunities; however, technical difficulties sometimes got in the way. It was also challenging to balance the fun of working with video games with the focus required to facilitate critical discussions. That said, the findings of this thesis support the potential of popular video games for emancipatory learning, nonetheless. Further research is needed on the role that different video games, or different video game genres altogether, could play in future gaming circles. The exploratory nature of this study also paves the way for further exploration with different learner groups and educational methods.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Le présent mémoire de maîtrise se compose d’une traduction de passages choisis d’Impossible Nation : Longing for Homeland in Canada and Quebec de Ray Conlogue et d’une analyse critique approfondie. L’essai, qui explore la fracture culturelle et linguistique entre le Québec et le Canada anglais, présente les réflexions de l’auteur sur le nationalisme, l’identité culturelle et la reconnaissance mutuelle. L’analyse critique aborde la question de la non-traduction de cet essai en français, en sondant les résistances (idéologiques, économiques et esthétiques), le contexte des années 1990 et la réception tiède qui a été réservée à l’ouvrage au Canada anglais. On y postule que, malgré la pertinence manifeste de l’essai pour le lectorat québécois dans un contexte de réflexion sur l’avenir du biculturalisme, le triomphe du paradigme néolibéral et le désintérêt croissant pour la question nationale qui en découle auraient défavorisé sa traduction.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Milić, Ana</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This project draws on the memories and life stories of six post-Yugoslav queer migrants - Nika, Senka, Leon, Bojan, Mato, and Željko - to offer insight into the interplay between the affective legacies of the Yugoslav socialist project, their sexual and gender identities, and their political imagination. I investigate how the migration trajectories of my research participants intersect with Western neoliberal ideologies and global constructions of sexual and gender identities, such as being “out” or celebrating pride. Using oral history as a method, I draw on their life stories to map the dissonances between their discursive and embodied experiences that were prompted by their movements across nation-state borders and communities. In doing so, I interrogate the linearity of developmental queer narratives of progress and homonormativity. Examining political imagination and sexual politics across various geopolitical-temporal and historical contexts, my research contests representations of the West as a place of progress and liberation.
Exploring themes of nostalgia, disillusionment, belonging, identity formation, and political visions of the world, I offer an interpretative analysis of the life stories and reflections shared by my interlocutors. Through this project, I formed a set of relationships of transnational queer diaspora that complicates and challenges both the memory of Yugoslavia and the image of the West as a place of progress and refuge for minoritarian subjects and I investigate whether reclaimed or shared memories resist official national histories to highlight how the nation-state framework constricts and regulates political imaginaries.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Moghaddas Borhan, Alireza</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Linux capabilities represent an important security feature for enabling fine-grained management of privileges. However, limitations in selectively enabling capabilities for processes and lagging adoption from application developers often lead the operators to run containers with unnecessary privileges. Although this can potentially be addressed by modifying the application, minimizing the set of enabled capabilities, assigning capabilities to executable files, or using user-space utilities like Ptrace, those solutions typically require manual efforts, only provide partial protection, or incur significant overhead. In this thesis, we present CapMan, a solution that secures privileged containers by detecting and mitigating potential capability abuses at runtime. Our main idea is threefold. First, CapMan examines all capability requests made by system calls to ensure full protection. Second, CapMan performs the detection directly inside the Linux kernel to ensure its efficiency. Third, CapMan performs the mitigation in a transparent manner without requiring any change made to the application or container. We tackle several key challenges in realizing  CapMan as follows: i) to ensure CapMan can cover every capability request, we study the Linux kernel source code to identify the kernel function used to handle such requests, and subsequently develop a kprobe-based kernel module to intercept those requests via that kernel function; ii) since user-space detection can introduce prohibitive delay,  we design CapMan to perform its detection completely inside the kernel based on lightweight whitelisting and machine learning methods; iii) as Linux only allows the container itself to drop capabilities, CapMan performs its mitigation by overriding such rules in a safe manner using standard kernel functions and procedures.} Our evaluation of CapMan using real-world CVEs and capability abuses shows that it can mitigate all the tested capability abuses (most of which are missed by a state-of-the-art solution) with negligible performance overhead and resource consumption.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis paper accompanying a research-creation video essay titled “Mainstreaming,” explores the impact of news consumption on individual’s worldviews, drawing primarily on Cultivation Theory by George Gerbner. The project explores cultivation deeply, especially the concepts of mainstreaming, the Mean World Syndrome, and resonance, while challenging some established notions and deterministic aspects of the theory. Employing a diverse range of methods, such as survey, interviews, and an experiment, the project focuses on four individuals, three categorized as politically left-leaning, and one categorized as alt-right in their news consumption profiles. The interviews of these subjects explore how these individuals actively curate their news intake and how the lived realities of these individuals do, or do not, come against the narratives of their media. Through experiment, the three left-leaning individuals were asked to alter their news consumption habits, revealing an active reinforcement and justification of their typical media. The analysis of the interviews and experiment leads to a reinterpretation of cultivation’s resonance. By establishing a difference between resonance that is more concrete versus abstract, the argument is made that lived experiences that are grounded in a subject’s lived reality serve as a means of preventing or limiting the effect of cultivation. The interview and analysis of the alt-right individual provides a case study in cultivation mainstreaming, highlighting a convergence in worldviews between him and the media that he consumes. The project overall suggests that individuals are not passive receivers of media’s messaging, and advocates for utilizing agency in the consumption of media.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>From Reel to Reality: Canadian Military Women’s Representation in Early National Film Board films, 1939-1945.</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis explores Canada’s significant societal transformation during the Second World War by analyzing the representation of military women in two National Film Board (NFB) films. Following Canada’s entry into the war on September 10, 1939, the demand for male recruits led to a labour shortage, opening unprecedented employment opportunities for women. These changes disrupted traditional gender roles, which had confined women to domestic responsibilities while men worked outside the home. In 1941, women became eligible for military service, marking a pivotal moment in Canada’s evolving social norms. Simultaneously, the Canadian government established the NFB, which was tasked with shaping public opinion through cinematic propaganda, including addressing societal concerns about shifting gender roles. This research focuses on two NFB films directed by Jane Marsh, Wings on Her Shoulder (1943) and Proudly She Marches (1943), as case studies to investigate how Canadian cinema reflected and responded to wartime social changes. It examines the ideological messages in these two films, particularly themes of femininity and subordination, while also contextualizing these portrayals within broader media representations. By comparing the depiction of women in the Canadian Armed Forces in these films with contemporaneous advertisements in magazines like Chatelaine and Maclean’s, this study highlights how Marsh’s films, while propagandistic, could be interpreted as progressive for their time. The primary purpose of this thesis is to examine the representations of military women in wartime films, analyzing how their portrayals conformed to and diverged from pre-war societal norms, and how these depictions were used to influence public opinion by presenting women in new social roles.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis examines the representation of Ukrainian and Palestinian refugees across three news outlets: CBC News, The New York Times, and Al Jazeera. Through a qualitative content analysis (QCA), the research draws on Stuart Hall's representation theory and Johan Galtung's peace journalism framework. While past studies documented how journalism has represented refugees fleeing war (Ajana et at., 2024; Greenbank, 2015; El-Nawawy &amp; Elmasry, 2023; Hoffman &amp; Hameleers, 2024; Elsamni, 2016), this research is motivated by a notable shift in 2022 when opinions positively changed in response to Ukrainians seeking refuge (Kapetanovic, 2022). The research also addresses the relative absence of scholarly attention to Palestinian refugees in news media. This is reflected in the analyzed sample articles where findings revealed significant disparities in news media representation. Ukrainian refugees were humanized through personal narratives, professional identities, and active agency in their lives and communities whereas Palestinian refugees were predominantly represented through statistics, collective representation, and limited agency. The study reveals a pattern of differential representation where Ukrainian refugees were depicted as educated contributors to society, in contrast to Palestinian refugees who were often framed as victims without individuality.

Additionally, the thesis highlights how the overall journalistic coverage of marginalized asylum seekers and refugees could be improved. It is important to note that the goal of this research is not to discredit the reporting on Ukrainian refugees. Instead, this thesis seeks to highlight the positive impacts such reporting may have had on the community while raising questions regarding the unequal coverage that communities in similar circumstances received. By identifying possible disparities in refugee representation, the research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of media representation and its effects.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A theoretical analysis of Nigerian politicians and their godfathers</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Nduka, Chidimma</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Political decision-making in Nigeria is often influenced by a system of patron-client relationships, commonly referred to as Godfatherism. This study examines how political Godfathers shape the policy choices of politicians and, in turn, affect democratic accountability. By extending the Maskin and Tirole (2004) model, this paper introduces the role of campaign contributions from Godfathers as a critical
factor in affecting political choices.
The theoretical framework considers a two-period model where elected politicians choose between policies that align with public welfare or the preferences of their Godfathers. The model accounts for re-election incentives, voter awareness, and institutional strength, revealing that politicians are likelier to prioritize the Godfather’s interests over public needs when electoral accountability is weak. The study also compares three governance structures which are Direct Democracy, Judicial Power, and Representative Democracy, to evaluate which system minimizes the distortive effects of this elite influence.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This research-creation MA thesis asks not just how our bodies are relational but how the process of embodiment is relational, and shows why this is important to collective flourishing. Prioritizing this alongside the unfolding climate crisis, the primary question in this thesis explores how our body’s intelligence intersects with planetary wellness, amplifying innate principles of reciprocity that exist throughout our bodies and the wider systems of life on Earth. Presenting healing modalities and strategies that emphasize the body's intelligence and centre concepts of interconnection, this research unites personal ritual, ceremony, dream and ancestor work, somatic therapy and plant medicine with art-making, scholarly research and writing. 

The resulting large-scale textile works, comprised of botanical cyanotypes, hand-embroideries and bilateral drawings on cloth, work together with a written thesis to critically examine the fascia of connectivity between individual, community and planetary wellness. Based in the offer of deep medicine to repair relationships “damaged through systems of domination”, this thesis juxtaposes Western medical frameworks around healing against personal experience and the wisdom of traditional and Indigenous cultures. This concludes with redefining the human body and health to encompass the living-systems theory of Healing Justice, where mutual flourishing forms the heart of personal and collective wellness, and showing that our body’s way-of-knowing is inherently linked to planetary health.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Evaluating Website Data Leaks through Spam Collection on
Honeypots</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Oyinloye, Oghenerukevwe Elohor</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>People increasingly rely on online services for communication, education, shopping, entertainment
etc., but this convenience comes with escalating spam volumes. Prior studies have linked spam primarily
to user behavior or data leaks but lacked effective methods to distinguish these causes. Our research
proposes using spam as a forensic indicator of data leaks and introduces a low-complexity fingerprinting
technique to trace leak sources, while evaluating consent and subscription practices of websites and
telecom.
We deployed 148 honeypots with 740 accounts across 370 websites in 12 communities over 12
months, analyzing 12,490 spam emails to assess forensic indicators and evaluate exposure, privacy policy
exploitation seen with legitimate websites under the Canadian Anti-Spam Law (CASL). Our method
was bench-marked against traditional leak detection models and fingerprinting techniques.
Our findings reveal that many legitimate websites exploit CASL consent practices by automatically
enrolling users in mailing lists via implicit consent, while sites requiring explicit consent often violate
their own policies, highlighting enforcement gaps. We recommend that regulators mandate a clear separation
between subscription agreements and privacy policies and require explicit third-party consent at
sign-up.
Additionally, our analysis shows that men aged 48–57 receive the highest spam volumes, with peak
activity between 00-04 minute of each hour, with peaks on Thursdays. These insights offer valuable
guidance for enhancing spam filtering models.
Using our analysis engine, we achieved 100% leak detection and 99.29% source attribution accuracy.
Compared to network intrusion detection, log analysis, machine learning, and traditional fingerprinting,
our method more effectively identifies compliance violations, traces leaks to their source, and estimates
exposure impact. Furthermore, to address telecom issues from phone number reassignments, we proposed
a nonce-based de-association method that promises significant spam reduction.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the last decade. Transformers, a type of DNN, have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) through models like ChatGPT, Llama and more recently, Deepseek. While transformers are used mostly in NLP tasks, their potential for advanced numerical computations remains largely unexplored. This presents opportunities in areas like surrogate modeling and raises fundamental questions about AI's mathematical capabilities.

We investigate the use of transformers for approximating matrix functions, which are mappings that extend scalar functions to matrices. These functions are ubiquitous in scientific applications, from continuous-time Markov chains (matrix exponential) to stability analysis of dynamical systems (matrix sign function). Our work makes two main contributions. First, we prove theoretical bounds on the depth and width requirements for ReLU DNNs to approximate the matrix exponential. Second, we use transformers with encoded matrix data to approximate general matrix functions and compare their performance to feedforward DNNs. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the choice of matrix encoding scheme significantly impacts transformer performance. Our results show strong accuracy in approximating the matrix sign function, suggesting transformers' potential for advanced mathematical computations.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>In an attempt to move beyond the activist re-imaginings of the AIDS pandemic that saturate the current media landscape, this thesis professes an alternate archive of personalized documentaries that articulate a counter-history of the AIDS crisis. Rather than merely frame these videos as solipsistic accounts of self-misery during a politicized pandemic, the thesis argues that these texts embody an ambivalent address that not only converses with the dominant politics of activist histories (epitomized by organizations like ACT UP) but also offer differing modes of constructing the self under the shadow of HIV/AIDS. Although it discusses a variety of texts from varying national contexts, the primary focus of this thesis is on four films from Canada, the United States, India, and Iran. Divided temporally, the thesis argues for the ways in which these films underscore the corporeal, existential, and familial dimensions of living in the shadow of AIDS. Moving from the negotiation of the altered body in The Broadcast Tapes of Dr. Peter and Silverlake Life (1993) to a queer-of-color critique of a dichotomous understanding of kinship during the AIDS crisis in Summer in My Veins (1999), the thesis underscores the myriad ways in which these personalized documents unsettle the established discourses laid forth by dominant AIDS politics. Finally, in order to draw attention to an ongoing global pandemic, the thesis concludes with Meteor (2023) to re-think notions of AIDS activist struggles first envisioned by AIDS coalitions. By bringing these hitherto marginalized archives into focus, the thesis aims to contribute to a multifaceted understanding of the AIDS crisis beyond the interventions of activist histories.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Authenticity, Heritage Shops, Shaping the Consumer Subject, Montreal</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>From the mid-1980s through the early-2020s, Montreal’s commercial landscape saw a proliferation of heritage shops selling imported items from South-Asia such as incense, crystals, clothing, jewelry, home décor, and more. Today, the city’s zeitgeist has changed, but these shops still remain. Hence, what efforts do these shop owners exert to construct their authenticity and keep this heritage consumer subject alive? Previous research has either taken too vast of an institutional approach in studying this phenomenon or has focused too closely on the product that is the consumer subject itself. Thus, the literature does not take a balanced approach by studying the retail market actors themselves and the actions they specifically take to shape their ideal consumer subject. To fill this gap, this research employs a qualitative approach, combining three research methods: in-depth interviews, fieldwork, and secondary data. Overall, this thesis uncovers the muti-layered process that heritage shop owners undertake to shape consumer subjects. It contributes to the marketing literature by applying existing notions of authenticity to a new commercial niche and geographical context and by investigating the role that shop owners specifically play in the ethnic market sphere. For managers, this study can serve as a beginner’s guide for opening a business—or filling in any gaps of an existing business— that employs the construct of authenticity as understood, perceived, and crafted through managers’ very own eyes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Integrating a Child-Centered Play Therapy Approach to Music Therapy Improvisation Facilitation for Children with Developmental Needs Within Mental Health Care Settings: A Philosophical Inquiry</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Poirier-Fournier, Elodie</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This philosophical inquiry explored the integration of a child-centered play therapy ap-proach in music therapy improvisation for children with developmental needs within mental health care settings. Drawing on Wigram’s (2004) five key components of the therapeutic process and on Landreth (2023)’s nine principles of child-centered play therapy, emphasis was placed on how these frameworks can be connected and applied to music therapy improvisation, following procedures typical in philosophical inquiry, such as defining terms, relating ideas, and connecting diverse conceptual and theoretical systems (Aigen, 2005). Relevant literature on the developmen-tal needs of children in mental health care, music therapy improvisation with children, and child-centered play therapy was reviewed to establish a foundation for the inquiry. The analysis high-lighted key implications for addressing developmental needs through music therapy improvisa-tion, including adopting an experience-oriented approach, practicing cultural humility, considering individual developmental stages, providing trauma-informed care, and creating space for the ex-pression of physical aggression. The affordances, challenges and limitations associated with the use of music therapy improvisation realized within a child-centered approach are discussed, alongside the limitations of the study and future research directions.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>In Support of Sustainability: Teaching Future Circus Artists in Québec</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Poole, Sarah Elizabeth</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This qualitative-interpretative research presents the experiences and observations of thirteen circus artists around the concept of professional sustainability, as they have come to understand it in their careers.  All thirteen had worked with me as their teacher in circus discipline classes  during their post-secondary education at the École nationale de cirque (ENC).  They graduated from the school’s three-year professionalizing program between the years of 2011 and 2021.  In semi-directed interviews, they spoke of their personal understandings of sustainability following years of professional experiences. They related their experiences of autonomy support within the learning environment we shared in classes.  The observations and memories of these circus artists, taken in dialogue with my reflexive analysis of own teaching behaviors, demonstrate an alignment between balanced career longevity and self-determination theory (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000).   The professionalizing education of circus artists today as performers, creators and athletes demands preparation not only for immediate employment, but also for long-term health and artistic growth. Circus artists creatively adapt to employment instability, variable working demands-conditions, injury and repetition.  Autonomy-supportive physical and creative learning environments within a high-performance professionalizing circus education can facilitate the development of intrinsic motivation, which will allow them to persist in a career in circus arts.

        <etd_ms:description>Bridges are critical infrastructure that significantly contribute to connectivity and economic growth. Ensuring their durability necessitates addressing dynamic effects from traffic loads, quantified through the Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF). This factor, influenced by bridge and vehicle parameters, poses challenges for accurate assessment due to the complex interplay of these factors.
This study undertook a comparative analysis of analytical models and revealed that DAF can be reliably estimated using bridge parameters. Results highlighted notable DAF variations even among bridges with similar spans and frequencies, exposing limitations in current design codes. While dynamic amplification generally decreased with increasing bridge span, the reduction also depended on bridge frequency. Higher vehicle velocities elevated DAF, but no consistent trend emerged due to the influence of bridge characteristics.
A 3D Finite Element Model in Abaqus, incorporating skew angles through the Vdload subroutine, showed minimal DAF variation for skew angles up to 30°, with a 20% increase observed at 45°. These findings emphasize the significance of skew angles on dynamic amplification.
The study proposes a DAF estimation approach based on bridge span and frequency. Validation against dynamic load test data showed consistency in 15 of 17 cases, with an error margin below 5%. A regression-based formula was developed, demonstrating alignment with existing codes while identifying inadequacies in DAF values for short to medium-span bridges.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Integration of a Solar Energy System at the Future Building Laboratory of Concordia University: Simulation, Analysis, and Testing of Different Operational Modes.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Prajapati, Jay Dipakkumar</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research explores the development and integration of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system and a vehicle-to-home (V2H) backup power system at the Future Building Laboratory (FBL) of Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec. The study addresses the challenges of rural electrification, proposing renewable energy systems as sustainable and eco-friendly solutions for off-grid applications. A modified electrical power system is designed for the FBL, incorporating critical loads, a subpanel, manual transfer switches, grid-forming and grid-following converters, battery storage, and an electric vehicle with a vehicle-to-home inverter. 
The system's performance is analyzed through simulation and experimental testing. Sunny Island (grid-forming/battery charger) and Sunny Boy (grid-following) were simulated in both standalone and grid-connected scenarios, with control strategies ensuring seamless operation in grid-forming and grid-following modes. Experimental results validate the simulations, demonstrating consistent performance of the converters under different operating conditions, including parallel operation.  
The research also explores vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) systems, highlighting the capability of EVs to serve as reliable emergency backup power sources. The experimental results demonstrate that integrating V2H technology with renewable energy systems enhances the overall resiliency and flexibility of decentralized power systems. Moreover, this EV to-home integration reduces reliance on traditional backup energy sources, thereby enhancing sustainability. 
Thus, this study provides a comprehensive framework for integrating solar PV power and EV technologies into decentralized power systems, demonstrating their potential to create scalable, reliable, and environmentally sustainable solutions for rural and remote electrification needs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The line between comedy and offence is often muddled. The funny and unfunny can appear identical to one another. This is especially the case when it comes to racial stereotype humour, which may sound very much like racist mockery. My thesis focuses on the comic value and harms of English spoken in an Asian accent, particularly East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) accents. Drawing on Elaine Chun’s work identifying “mock Asian” as a variety of English “that indexes a stereotypical Asian identity” (263), I analyze the use of mock Asian in fictional representations of East Asians on screen. Beginning with Gedde Watanabe’s (in)famous performance of Long Duk Dong in the film Sixteen Candles (1984), I also consider the vernacular and dialectic stand-up of Margaret Cho in Notorious C.H.O (2002) and Jimmy O. Yang in Good Deal (2020) before turning to the L.A.-based Malaysian comedian Nigel Ng and his accented alter-ego Uncle Roger. Finally, I propose that the relationship between Asian-accented English representations and modern Asian identity construction may be especially clearly illuminated in relation to the linguistic category of “Chinglish.”</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Each year, ships filled with tons of discarded secondhand clothes from Europe and Americaarrive to the coast of East Africa to be sold, often ending up in colossal landfills due to the poor condition in which they arrive. The government of Rwanda, following its policy guidelines of agaciro, or autonomy, decided to ban the importation of all secondhand clothing in 2018, with the objective of developing the local fashion industry. This considerably transformed the fashion landscape in Rwanda, and although this initial objective of stimulating production for local consumption did not succeed, it did contribute in propelling Kigali-based designers to new heights in the international fashion scene. This thesis analyzes this Kigali fashion scene as a way to garner critical insights from its designers on the way that the industry works, and on ways in which they break free from the power dynamics imposed by colonization and globalization.</etd_ms:description>

Optimizing and Validating the Performance of a Low-cost Potentiostat for In-Situ Flow Battery Testing
Dharik Purohit
This thesis relates to the design, optimization, and validation of a low-cost potentiostat tailored specifically for the requirements of flow battery testing. The primary objective is to deliver a reliable solution that maintains high-performance standards necessary for precise electrochemical measurements, achieved through simplified circuit design, affordable components, and open-source software.
The potentiostat design incorporates an expanded compliance voltage of ±2.5V, dynamic current range selection using a multiplexer, and enhanced noise filtering for accurate operation in aqueous systems and microelectrode setups. The system’s functionality was further extended with the addition of features like two-way pulse testing and battery charge-discharge testing over multiple cycles. Comprehensive performance validation was conducted to ensure the potentiostat meets the requirements for electrochemical applications, with tests focused on accuracy, stability, and flexibility across a range of experimental conditions.
The CellStat’s design specifications were derived through simulations and theoretical calculations, including the assessment of compliance voltage, DAC/ADC resolution, and projected measurement errors. These theoretical benchmarks were validated through cyclic voltammetry experiments under varying scan rates, showcasing the potentiostat’s ability to reliably measure and control redox reactions in flow batteries. The work highlights the potential for low-cost, open source potentiostats to meet the growing demand for accessible electrochemical testing tools, supporting advancements in renewable energy technologies.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Music Therapy, Music, Music Students, Music Education, Relationship with Music, Undergraduate Music Students, Qualitative Interview Study</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Literature indicates that many undergraduate university students face challenges that may have significant impacts on their mental health and well-being. Furthermore, research indicates that undergraduate music students face unique challenges specific to their field of study. As an undergraduate music performance student, the researcher experienced some of these challenges, and as a music therapist, she felt that music therapy held potential to help. Therefore, the purpose of this study was twofold: to understand undergraduate music students’ perceptions on how their university music training experiences have changed their relationships with music, and to explore how music therapy could potentially serve as a personal resource for undergraduate music students, specifically with regard to fostering and/or maintaining a constructive relationship with music. Three undergraduate music students participated in individual qualitative interviews. A narrative summary of each participant’s interview was created. A cross-case analysis of these narrative summaries revealed themes that emerged within three pre-determined categories: (a) university music training experiences perceived as having a positive/helpful impact on participants’ relationship with music, (b) university music training experiences perceived as having a negative/unhelpful impact on participants’ relationship with music, and (c) participants’ perspectives on engaging in music therapy as a way of fostering and/or maintaining a constructive relationship with music. Limitations of the study, implications for music therapy practice, education, and advocacy as well as recommendations for future research are presented.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>YOU WILL NOT WIN AND YOU MUST DIE, YOU CHURL: Re-Structuring Beowulf’s Polyvalence using Interactive Fiction</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Radoeva, Dimana</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This research-creation thesis presents a game experience of close reading the Old English poem Beowulf that prioritizes a multivocal structure of the text. It builds upon existing scholarship, like Kevin Kiernan’s, addressing the interpretative potential of the Vitellius manuscript’s evidence of variance. The poem’s fifty-year temporal shift at its mid-point is used as a contextual offramp to highlight its fragmentary construction. A literary analysis of the various hegemonic structures Beowulf participates in and perpetuates problematizes his status as an immutable heroic figure. John D. Niles, Frederick Klaeber, Gale Owen-Crocker, and T.S Miller are amongst those cited as shaping the existing discourse on Beowulf’s identity outside of the confines of the poem’s hierarchical structure. By re-contextualizing his death and legacy in an interactive fiction game-world titled YOU WILL NOT WIN AND YOU MUST DIE, YOU CHURL, this thesis adapts sections of Beowulf as inter-connected pieces of a hypertextual system. The principal aims of the game’s designing processes are two-fold: prioritizing the voices and perspectives of Beowulf’s supporting cast of characters while stretching the limitations of narrative cohesion in the hypertext genre. To connect the thesis’ academic argument with this creative component, Nick Montfort’s Twisty Little Passages and Espen Aarseth’s Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature influence the approach towards IF that complements the act of close reading. By gamifying the interpretative textuality of Beowulf, the final build of the game encourages players to view ludic choice-making and literary analysis as similar repeatable acts leading to multiple points of (re-)entry to a text.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Electric Vehicles (EVs) have gained significant popularity as a sustainable alternative to traditional vehicles, leading to the rapid deployment of EV Charging Stations (CSs). While vulnerabilities have been discovered in CSs with remote management portals, those requiring physical access are considered secure and have received less attention. This thesis introduces the first attack framework targeting these CSs that require physical access to operate their local management portal. By testing six real-world CSs deployed across North America and Europe, the thesis demonstrates how attackers can exploit design flaws to escalate privileges, manipulate configurations, and launch attacks that disrupt the power grid, enable financial fraud, and compromise charging infrastructure availability. In response to these vulnerabilities and cyberattack threats, the research develops EV-Shield, a real-time monitoring platform that collects and correlates data from multiple EV ecosystem components including CSs and the EV Charging Station Management System (CSMS). The platform is integrated with HydraEV, a distributed anomaly detection module that enables attack detection through its local and central detectors. By incorporating Smart Meters (SMs) as a novel monitoring component, EV-Shield enhances its resilience, ensuring reliable detection even when other data sources are compromised. The platform's performance is evaluated through multiple attack scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in safeguarding the public EV charging infrastructure. This thesis addresses critical security challenges in the rapidly evolving EV ecosystem, focusing on CS vulnerabilities and developing a real-time monitoring platform to detect cyberattacks. The goal is to ensure the safe and reliable expansion of EV infrastructure amid growing cybersecurity threats.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Genesis 3:22 is like a proverbial fork in the road for advocates of the doctrine of monotheism who argue for the belief in the existence of one God in ancient Israelite religious life. The pericope implicitly posits a version of divinity that contradicts the monotheistic claim because it briefly depicts Yahweh conversing with other entities he acknowledges as divine, like himself. Consequently, this thesis paper aims to critically revisit the representation and conceptualization of the divine in the Eden narrative. The purpose is to discover how the text represents this concept despite traditional presuppositions. A qualitative approach centered on the synchronic evaluation of the Hebrew text is prioritized in this research. A macro syntactic analysis is used to dissect the text. Additionally, a hermeneutics informed by methods from text linguistics and some elements of semiotics is employed to produce an innovative translation that exhibits biblical Hebrew’s modal and volitive nuances and reveals rhetorical and literary techniques the authors designed to convey their message. This investigation is supplemented by a comparative study of the biblical writers’ use of concepts like the Divine Council and words like the abstract plural אֱלֹהִ֔ים with cognates from the late Bronze Age ancient Near East, which is the period and geographical milieu for the emergence of ancient Israel as a people. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that the authors might have constructed this profound story based on typical ancient Near East primeval myths to establish Yahweh as governor over gods and humans but also meant to invite the audience to imagine divine governance that is non-coercive and relational.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Turning Shareholder Pressure into Actions: The Impact of Environmental Shareholder Activism on Corporate Environmental Disclosure</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Saviz, Samiyar</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>Environmental Shareholder Activism, Environmental Information Disclosure, Signalling Theory, Socially Responsible Investing, Reputational Damage</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Environmental shareholder activism has increasingly gained attention as an influential mechanism shaping firms’ environmental reporting practices, yet prior research yields mixed findings on its impact. Whereas some argue that activism fosters substantive transparency, others maintain its influence as largely symbolic. To address these mixed findings, I examined whether environmental shareholder activism—particularly when initiated by institutional investors—influences the extent of firms’ environmental disclosures. Drawing on signaling theory, I proposed that environmental shareholder activists can pressure firms to issue stronger “signals” of environmental responsibility by enhancing their environmental reporting practices and that such pressure is more pronounced when driven by institutional investors. In this view, activism reduces information asymmetry and pressures firms to mitigate reputational risk, prompting more detailed or transparent reporting. I examined these arguments by testing hypotheses in the context of S&amp;P 500 companies listed in 2023 over the period 2016–2023. The findings indicate that environmental shareholder activism does not significantly influence corporate environmental disclosure, suggesting that firms may respond to activist pressure through symbolic compliance or private engagements rather than public transparency. However, industry pressures remain a key determinant, with firms in high-pollution sectors engaging in significantly greater environmental disclosure independent of activist influence.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Futures is a novel about Calgary in 2011. Set in the midst of the city’s volatile economic boom, the narrative follows Lyle Oglov’s coming-of-age journey as he navigates uncertainty in his own life and in the world. Drawing on traditions of paranoid fiction in the vein of DeLillo and Pynchon, as well as classic Bildungsroman and picaresque novels such as The Catcher in the Rye and A Confederacy of Dunces, the novel inverts these predecessors, and offers a satirical critique of the contradictions inherent in art-making, activism, and daily life within an extractive economy, exploring the futility of dogmatic adherence to both mainstream narratives and their alternatives.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Rate making in insurance refers to the pricing of insurance premiums through calculations, by actuaries, and adjustments in various factors. Fair pricing of insurance products is of utmost importance for insurance companies to be able to face market competition and stay in business. Therefore poor rate making, which could be the result of poor prediction of risks, would be dangerous for insurers.

Insurance data is characterized by an imbalance between the number of policyholders that claim and those that do not. The majority of premium payers do not incur accidents and thus do not claim their losses, resulting in a large number of “zero–claims". However, it is very important for the company to identify the customers who are more likely in future to file a claim, because every claim incurs a cost to the enterprise. Chapter 1 proposes a sampling technique devised to improve the identification of the possible future losses by better tracking of the non–zero claims.

Generalized Linear Models have long been used by actuaries to accomplish the rate making task. The method is parametric and is based on certain assumptions about the distribution of the data. Insurance data with its probability mass at zero, do not fall exactly into the framework of GLMs. However, in the recent years, various new machine learning algorithms have provided improvement by being more effective predictors than GLMs. What these algorithms lack is interpretability. Chapter 2 uses simple algorithms like regression trees, in combination with GLMs, to create a pre–processed GLM that is more effective than a standalone GLM.

The endeavour of improving the classical GLM continues in Chapter 3. Here the another combination of trees and regularized GLMNet is used to produce results with more predictive capability that any one of these algorithms as stand-alone. The new results are interpretable as well as improved.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>The current research explores the application of advanced machine learning and ensemble learning techniques to address the challenges of backorder prediction in supply chain management, specifically when the dataset is severely imbalanced. Considering the critical importance of accurate forecasting in supply chains, this study evaluates the performance of five resampling techniques (Random Under Sampling, ADASYN, SMOTE-ENN, Borderline-SMOTE, and SMOTE-SVM), combined with hyperparameter tuning (Randomized Search CV) and two cross-validation methods (5-fold and 10-fold). The research methodology involved training 98 combinations of two machine learning and five ensemble learning models, incorporating feature selection with SHAP and dimensionality reduction using PCA, alongside sophisticated data preprocessing techniques such as MICE for handling missing values. The primary evaluation metric is AUC-ROC, complemented by secondary metrics including balanced accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC-PR, ensuring a holistic assessment of model performance. Key findings demonstrate that ensemble learning models, particularly XGBoost, outperforms classical machine learning models in terms of robustness and being accurate in backorder prediction. Resampling techniques such as SMOTE-ENN and Random Under Sampling significantly enhance model performance, with SMOTE-ENN proving especially effective due to its noise reduction capabilities. Interestingly, dimensionality reduction using PCA was found to have little benefit, whereas feature selection using SHAP consistently improved efficiency and accuracy. The insights derived from this study provide a comprehensive framework for improving predictive performance in supply chain management applications, specifically backorder prediction. By addressing class imbalance, optimizing preprocessing techniques, and rigorously evaluating resampling methods, this research establishes best practices for tackling forecasting challenges in imbalanced, high-dimensional data environments.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>Is there room for religion in the public square? This simple, yet heavy question has been constant and evolving since the Enlightenment period. Prior to this period in the context of Latin
Christendom, the answer was an obvious ‘yes’. The innovative idea that the answer might be ‘no’ has had an immense impact on Church-State relations in various Western contexts in the past 250 years. The experiments in secularity within the past few hundred years wrestling with this question are explored in brief detail. One of the social imaginaries that emerged in France is the concept of laïcité. It is important to address the historical roots of the ideology of laïcité within the broader context of emerging Western secularities. Grievances present within this ideology are also addressed, culminating with a deconstruction of its totalizing features that seek to marginalize other burgeoning ideas of secularity. Ignatian Pedagogy will be illustrated as one of the many examples that illustrate the deprivatization of religion in the public sphere. Furthermore, it will be discussed in terms of its applicability to all students in hopes of both greater human flourishing, and an accomplishment of the possibility for religious freedom and peace among differences, meeting a central goal of the Peace of Westphalia.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in
Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Sharma, Vasudev</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in computational pathology, offering the ability to perform zero-shot diagnostic inference on gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). However, a core challenge remains: these models exhibit high sensitivity to the linguistic structure and specificity of prompts, which can significantly impact diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical interpretability. This thesis systematically investigates the role of prompt engineering in enhancing the diagnostic performance of VLMs in histopathology. We propose a structured prompt engineering framework that modulates four critical dimensions: anatomical precision, information density, instructional framing, and output constraints, to evaluate their effect on model behavior. Using a clinically validated in-house dataset of 3,507 digestive system WSIs spanning multiple tissue types and pathological conditions, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of four state of the art VLMs called Biomedical Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (BioMedCLIP), Quilt-Net, Quilt-Large Language and Vision Assistant (Quilt-LLAVA), and  Contrastive Learning from captions for Histopathology (CONCH). Our methodology includes a combination of quantitative assessments using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis , Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and qualitative analyses to understand how prompt design influences diagnostic inference, interpretability, and generalization across tissues.

Our results demonstrate that prompt formulation significantly affects model performance across the full dataset. In particular, prompts that incorporate high anatomical specificity and clear instructional framing yield consistent improvements in classification accuracy across multiple tissue sites. The study further reveals that domain aligned prompting strategies are often more effective than increase in architectural complexity, highlighting the centrality of human and AI communication in medical vision-language tasks. In addition to empirical findings, we contribute actionable guidelines for implementing VLMs in clinical computational pathology workflows, emphasizing prompt standardization and interpretability. This work shifts the emphasis from purely architectural innovation to optimizing the language mediated interface between human expertise and AI systems, thereby enhancing both diagnostic performance and clinical utility in zero-shot medical image analysis.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>High-mobility wireless environments—such as those experienced in vehicular or aerial networks—pose significant challenges to reliable communication. Rapid time variations and frequency dispersion in these environments lead to severe intersymbol interference and signal distortion. Conventional modulation schemes and channel estimation methods, which are often based on a time-frequency representation, struggle to maintain performance under such conditions. Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) has emerged as a promising modulation technique for next-generation wireless networks due to its flexibility and efficient spectrum usage. However, its conventional formulation does not adequately address the dynamic nature of high-mobility channels.
This thesis presents a novel approach that redefines the GFDM system model in the delay-Doppler domain. The delay-Doppler domain offers a natural framework for representing channels in high-mobility scenarios, as it captures the sparse structure of the channel more effectively than the conventional time-frequency domain. By transforming the GFDM signal into the delay-Doppler domain, our method exploits the inherent sparsity of the channel, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient channel estimation. Additionally, a superimposed pilot scheme is introduced, whereby pilot symbols are embedded within the data-bearing frame. This strategy eliminates the need for dedicated pilot-only regions, thus significantly enhancing spectral efficiency.
Based on the new system model, we investigate two channel estimation methods. The first approach employs a compressed sensing technique using the Subspace Pursuit (SP) algorithm. This method reconstructs the channel vector from a limited number of measurements, leveraging the sparse nature of the channel. It offers low computational complexity, which is beneficial for real-time implementations. However, the SP algorithm requires prior knowledge of the channel’s sparsity level—a parameter that is often difficult to determine in practice.
To overcome this limitation, the second method adopts Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) for channel estimation. SBL integrates prior information about the channel’s sparse structure directly into a Bayesian inference framework, allowing it to both accurately estimate the key channel parameters and identify the positions of the non-zero elements without requiring a priori sparsity knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that the SBL-based estimator outperforms the SP algorithm, particularly in scenarios where pilot overhead is constrained.
Building on these estimation techniques, the thesis further extends the proposed framework to incorporate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). RIS are composed of numerous passive reflecting elements that can dynamically adjust their reflection coefficients. By optimizing these coefficients, the RIS can steer the reflected signals to constructively combine with the direct path, thereby enhancing the overall channel gain and system capacity. Hence, a low-complexity phase optimization strategy is then employed to tune the RIS phase coefficients, maximizing the effective channel gain and improving the achievable rate.
The extensive simulation results presented in this thesis validate the performance of the proposed methods. Our findings indicate that the new GFDM system model in the delay-Doppler domain leads to significant improvements in channel estimation accuracy and robustness in high-mobility scenarios. The superimposed pilot scheme enhances spectral efficiency by embedding pilot symbols within the data frame, and the SBL-based channel estimator demonstrates superior performance over conventional greedy methods such as SP. Moreover, the integration of RIS with optimized phase shifts further increases the achievable rate and overall system capacity compared to systems with random phase configurations or without RIS support.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis focuses on the practice of contemporary visual artist Satch Hoyt, who employs what I am calling an “Afrosonic aesthetic”. Beginning with Hoyt’s expansive art making practice and theory of the Eternal Migration of the Afro Sonic Signifier as an entry point, I argue that Black contemporary artists are attuned to the frequency of Black life, continually creating and accessing technologies that attend to a sonic past, present, and future. This thesis seeks to investigate the sonicity of Hoyt’s artworks that recall this frequency. By drawing upon a constellation of Black Study, blurring the borders of aesthetics, and engaging Hoyt’s Afro Sonic Mapping research project, this thesis shapes a living methodology that can identify, analyze, and archive artworks that contain this notion of an Afrosonic aesthetic to the art historical canon.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Ins and Outs is a novel that explores the dynamics of a first encounter between its two protagonists, Hannah and Mark, who meet online on a photography subreddit. After two years of photo exchanges and video chats, Hannah decides to accept Mark’s invitation to stay with him in New York City: there is a retrospective at MOMA of the photographer Hannah Molson, whom they both admire and whose work they have discussed at length. Mark is a loner who is obsessed with time and numbers, convinced that every significant action he makes must align with a specific point in time. He looks for meaningful coincidences everywhere to reassure himself that he’s on the right path. The encounter with Hannah, whom he’s fallen in love with, pushes his defense mechanisms into overdrive as he invents nightmare scenarios to preclude the possibility of them taking place in real life; Mark believes that to imagine a situation is to erase it from reality. In this way, the novel deals with the mechanics of decision-making, how over-thinking can lead to anxiety and paralysis, and the role magical thinking plays in our choices, a pseudo-rationalization of a chaotic universe that is in fact highly irrational.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Orbits &amp; Animals is a poetic bildungsroman exploring a longing for genuine connection, gendered perspectives on mental illness, and the ways in which girlhood ruminates throughout the course of a woman’s early adulthood. The primary component of the collection is poems in which the sustained speaker addresses various “you” figures and considers the ways in which these relationships have affected her. While the reader is not made aware of who the different “you” figures are specifically, the context of each poem indicates the nature of the relationship. Sections from a crown of sonnets in which the speaker addresses the “you” figure meant to be her mother are interspersed throughout the collection, guiding the reader chronologically and emphasizing the ways in which the speaker’s earliest relationships have influenced her later relationships. Additionally, the collection explores the speaker’s relationship with depictions of mental illness often deemed “feminine,” such as unstable moods, a distorted self-image, and an intense fear of abandonment. Finally, the speaker often refers to a sense of disembodiment she feels in comparison to other people, which she emphasizes through relating to various animals. The project is inspired by confessional poets such as Sylvia Plath and Richard Siken, as well as the work of contemporary songwriters such as Phoebe Bridgers and Adrianne Lenker, all of whom explore the relationships they strive to have but feel are just out of their grasp.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This study investigates the socio-economic determinants of infant mor- tality rates using panel data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) for over 100 countries spanning multiple decades. Given the potential endogeneity in the fertility-mortality relationship, a two-stage least squares (G2SLS) instrumental variable (IV) approach is employed, us- ing the second lag of fertility as an instrument. This strategy accounts for reverse causality and omitted variable bias, ensuring more robust estimates of the causal effect of fertility on infant mortality. A fixed-effects regres- sion model is implemented to analyze the dynamic effects of fertility rate, real GDP per capita, urbanization, and economic growth on infant mortal- ity, incorporating interaction terms to examine how economic development moderates the impact of fertility. The results confirm that higher fertility rates are associated with increased infant mortality, but this effect dimin- ishes in wealthier economies, highlighting the role of economic development in mitigating child mortality risks. Additionally, urbanization and short- term economic growth exhibit significant negative associations with infant mortality, underscoring the importance of healthcare access and economic stability in improving child health outcomes.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:subject>Quebec Education Policy, critical discourse analysis</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>This critical policy analysis seeks to identify the underlying ideologies, as well as the government’s motivations and intentions, by examining the Policy on Educational Success (PES) (Gouvernement du Québec, 2017). The PES was developed to provide a framework for educational reforms from 2017 to 2030 in Quebec. This analysis considers the influence of globalization and the unique socio-political context of Quebec while utilizing Fairclough’s (2007) and Bacchi’s (2016) critical discourse analysis. The results indicate the PES mirrors many structural reform recommendations found in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) education policy. This analysis finds that these reforms are integrated within the Quebec education system with two intentions. The first is to cultivate human capital to support and sustain economic development. The second and most prominent intention of the PES is to inculcate the population with a national identity, dominated by Quebec values of secularism and the French language. The conclusion of this thesis is a warning that the reform recommendations of the OECD, in the movement toward globalization, are creating systems of centralized authority, which are vulnerable to being co-opted by government powers and used for the indoctrination of the population. This analysis contributes to the body of research on education policy, specifically, on Quebec education policy, providing a much-needed critical perspective.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis critically examines how artistic narratives in contemporary manga represent asexuality, exploring their role in shaping community dynamics and influencing identity formation. Through an in-depth analysis of two selected works - Our Dreams at Dusk (March 6, 2015 – May 16, 2018) by Yuhki Kamatani and I Want to Be a Wall (May 17, 2022 – June 18, 2024) by Honami Shirono - this study investigates the ways in which these narratives contribute to the understanding and visibility of asexual identities. Through these texts, this research investigates the multifaceted representations of asexual identities within - and against their interactions - with allonormative constructs. This thesis employs a multidisciplinary approach, integrating asexual theory into visual analysis, with the aim of shedding light on the complexities of asexual identities as depicted through artistic, linguistic, and narrative expressions. The first section offers detailed case studies of the selected manga, beginning with Kamatani’s Our Dreams at Dusk. Here, linguistic performativity, spatial metaphors, and visual distance are analyzed as mechanisms for addressing themes of self-discovery and community. In contrast, Shirono’s I Want to Be a Wall explores asexuality within relational contexts, highlighting the impact of allonormativity, visual and emotional alienation, and essentialist societal pressures; while also presenting queerplatonic relationships as transformative kinship models, offering alternative ways to conceptualize intimacy and connection. In the second section, the focus shifts to audience reception. This part examines reader reviews and interpretations sourced from independent blogs and other platforms, revealing how audiences engage with and respond to asexual representations in these works. By analyzing both positive and critical feedback, the study considers whether these narratives empower or alienate readers, particularly those with limited prior exposure to asexuality. Such responses provide insight into how artistic portrayals contribute to public discourse on intimacy and sexuality, challenging conventional norms and expanding perspectives. Ultimately, this thesis bridges the gap between creative representation and cultural understanding. It argues that manga has the potential to function as a form of narrative activism, reshaping perceptions of identity and fostering inclusive conversations. By offering nuanced and authentic portrayals of asexuality, these works not only combat misconceptions but also amplify marginalized voices, positioning manga as a vital medium in the global discourse on identity, intimacy, community, and asexuality.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Between the Lines: The Clothing of Edna St. Vincent Millay.</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Subotincic West, Yesha</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>As a poet and playwright, Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950) was one of the most famous women in America during her lifetime. This thesis examines Millay’s public and private personas as well as her relationship to homosexuality and heterosexuality, through the veil of her clothing.  Millay was a complex person but if one only looks at her biography and not her clothing, one can argue she was quite a radical bohemian. However, in her private life, Millay’s writing and clothing reveal that she lived life following her passions, whereas in her public persona she was significantly more restrained within a conventional presentation. The separation Millay makes between her public and private lives, is made abundantly clear through her choice of clothing. As part of this thesis I have therefore, recreated, with video documentation of the process, two distinct ensembles worn by Millay. The first ensemble looks at Millay’s public persona in a fashionable and feminine tan linen dress from the most widely circulated image of her, taken by Arnold Genthe in 1914. The second ensemble is from a photograph taken by Berenice Abbott in 1925 that shows Millay with a bobbed haircut in a man’s shirt and tie, and a woman’s suit. This ensemble was chosen for the photograph that would appear in her first book after becoming the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1923. Perhaps this more masculine presentation was her way of holding her own among the previous all male recipients. A study of Millay's clothing offers valuable insights not only into how she chose to present herself to the world, revealing her desires, preferences, politics and nuanced aspects of her personality, but also how she chose to incorporate and respond to the culture and times as these changed over her lifetime.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This article develops and estimates a model of online purchase behavior using clickstream data from a branded merchandise store. The model links consumers’ purchase amounts to how they browse the website in three distinct windows—day-of, short-term, and long-term—before making a transaction. Focusing on session frequency, cart usage, and product detail views, we employ a finite mixture approach to account for unobserved heterogeneity across users. Our results reveal three distinct segments of online shoppers: low-spending task-focused buyers, moderate spending explorers, and high-spending advance planners. Each segment displays unique patterns of search depth, cart interaction, and timing. We find that day-of visits drive quick purchasing among lower spenders, whereas long-term browsing and comprehensive product
reviews play a critical role for high-value orders. These findings underscore the importance of segment-specific, time-targeted strategies for digital retailers seeking to enhance basket values and tailor website design to varying consumer needs.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>My research aims to investigate to what extent Artificial Intelligence (AI), like Generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) can be used to facilitate or enhance dialogic education (DE) on complex topics like climate science, particularly in university settings. Discussions involving climate science are often polarizing because they concern not only the sciences, but a multitude of interconnected socio-economic concerns. Consequently, the likelihood of reaching consensus or compromise is complicated by the diversity of perspectives involved. The ability to have constructive conversations on these topics is therefore essential to this process because environmental action and policy decisions are collaborative problem-solving endeavors among individuals from multiple backgrounds and perspectives. My research involved developing a custom GPT (Agora) based on dialogic principles and testing its performance while collecting data on user interactions. Agora was used as part of a focus group study that included 11 participants who engaged with Agora on topics related to climate science. The study also included discussion periods before and after the Agora interactions. Data from surveys, reflection exercises, and chat logs were analyzed to determine the extent to which Agora facilitated DE, and to better understand user experiences and preferences when conversing with Agora. The results of the study showed that Agora was able to facilitate DE by asking questions that encouraged participants to reflect on their beliefs and assumptions. Participants also expressed increased interest in using GPTs for personal applications in the future, despite their initial reservations about AI. The study also revealed that the quality of interactions with Agora depended largely on the participants' expectations, perceptions, motivations, and approaches. Additionally, reflection exercises indicated that many participants currently struggle with having conversations about climate change, including with those in their personal networks. Some of these struggles included barriers to perspective-taking and perspective-getting, emotional regulation, and conflict resolution. As such, participants expressed a strong interest in learning how to better communicate with others on climate topics, and in receiving personalized guidance on how to navigate interpersonal challenges without alienating others. These insights suggest that there is a need for skills development in climate communication, and that a DE approach in combination with AI could be a promising avenue for addressing this need.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Novel Probabilistic Frameworks for Author-Level Topic Modeling</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tahsin, Faiza</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>The increasing complexity of textual data in modern applications, such as social media and academic literature analysis, needs improved topic modeling techniques that capture sparsity, variability, and nuanced author-topic relationships. Because of their rigorous assumptions and inadequate adaptability in representing various data, traditional models generally fail to address these shortcomings. We present two novel probabilistic models, Author Dirichlet Multinomial Allocation with Generalized Distribution (ADMAGD) and Author Beta-Liouville Multinomial Allocation (ABLiMA) to overcome these drawbacks while strengthening the state of author-specific topic modeling. To depict complex author-topic relationships, ADMAGD incorporates the Generalized Dirichlet distribution. For datasets with uneven or absent topic representations, ABLiMA uses the Beta-Liouville distribution to adjust for topic distribution variability and sparsity. By comparing these models to common datasets like the NIPS and 20 Newsgroups datasets, the research presented here demonstrates how well these models manage sparsity, capture complex theme preferences, and generate coherent subjects. The results show that the models can be applied to many situations. Coherence measure and author-topic relationship visualizations further validate their interpretability and usefulness.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>An Ontology-Based Model for In-Network Computing Components Description and Discovery</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Tasnim, Zarin</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>In-Network Computing (INC) refers to the process that enables the distribution of computing tasks across the network instead of computing on servers outside the network. Advances in programmable hardware allow computations directly within network devices, such as switches and Smart Network Interface Cards (smart NICs), as data passes through them, and thereby reduces network congestion, minimizes reliance on distant cloud servers, and improves latency.

The growing demand for ultra-low delays, high bandwidth, and the ability to dynamically synchronize data streams in emerging applications, particularly Holographic-Type Communication application, is pushing the limits of current network infrastructures, with INC emerging as a promising solution as it aims to meet these stringent requirements. In addition, efficient provisioning of INC requires a comprehensive understanding of INC components, including their specifications, configuration information, and requirements. Nevertheless, an architecture with a description and discovery model offers a structured and standardized framework to represent INC components, defining their functionality and characteristics, and retrieving the most pertinent INC components according to the user requirements.

This thesis proposes a novel architecture for describing and discovering the most relevant INC components based on user preferences, specifically tailored for holographic-type application. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we introduce the In-Network Computing Ontology (INCO), a domain-independent, ontology-based description model that provides a semantic representation of INC components, facilitating their discovery from a centralized repository. The description model covers both the functional and non-functional specifications of INC components and consists of two parts: a generic description for INC components and an extension detailing four specific INC components (i.e. encoder, decoder, transcoder, and renderer)- essential for our holographic application use case. Second, we present a semantic matchmaking algorithm that leverages the INCO model to automatically identify and select the most appropriate INC components based on user requests and preferences. Lastly, we validate the proposed approach through experimental simulations, demonstrating the algorithm’s effectiveness in terms of response time and consistency. Response time was measured based on two criteria: query complexity and the number of retrieved instances. The simulation results indicate that response time fluctuates with increasing query complexity, while it remains comparatively stable as the number of retrieved instances grows.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:creator>Toghiani Khorasgani, Alireza</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis studies the application and impact of deep learning methods in anomaly detection, a critical area within security applications. While deep learning's popularity is driven by its perceived ability to manage complex patterns in large datasets and perform feature engineering inherently, this thesis questions these assumptions. By revisiting feature selection and data augmentation techniques, this research evaluates their effectiveness in improving the performance of deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, it examines the impact of other essential factors such as model choice (both traditional machine learning and deep learning), data balancing, and hyperparameter tuning on anomaly detection performance.

From these investigations, the thesis reports that the common beliefs surrounding deep learning are not universally valid, highlighting the need for a framework to evaluate the usefulness of features and data for specific cases. To address this gap, a new framework is proposed, guiding data users and anomaly detection tools toward optimal configurations, including feature selection, model selection, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated using two major IoT datasets, offering insights into improving anomaly detection systems through strategic and evidence-based approaches.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This study examines the financial impact of the 2023 armed conflict between Israel and Hamas which is a Palestinian militant group and political organization that governs the Gaza Strip on the stock markets and on specific industries in Israel, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia. We analyze three key dates in 2023: October 7th, when hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen stormed Israel's Gaza perimeter fence and attacked several nearby Israeli communities, leading Israel to declare war and conduct retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza; November 21st, when the state of Israel and the organization of Hamas agreed to a four-day pause in armed hostilities; and December 1st, when the pause in armed hostilities ended, and hostilities resumed. We use event study methodology to assess stock price reactions in the Israeli, Palestinian, and Saudi Arabian stock markets, along with industry-specific effects, and our results show that all three markets experience negative abnormal returns around October 7th. Conversely, we observe positive abnormal returns across all three stock markets on November 21st. Notably, when the conflict resumed on December 1st, the Israeli and Saudi Arabian stock markets exhibited positive abnormal returns. Additionally, our findings reveal that different industries are affected to varying degrees on these three dates. We used cross-sectional regression analyses and found that publicly traded companies with strong profitability and high market valuation were significantly more affected by the armed conflict.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Numerical modeling of the long-term poromechanical performance of deep geothermal energy systems</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>In recent years, the technological development of carbon-free energy sources has gained increasing attention among communities. Among various clean energy sources, geothermal energy stands out as an environmentally friendly alternative that is not affected by weather fluctuations, like solar and wind energy, and does not generate harmful waste, unlike nuclear energy. Geothermal energy production involves extracting the naturally stored heat within the Earth's crust for direct use or electricity generation. This process requires drilling one or more boreholes into the targeted formation, where fluid is injected and circulated to extract heat from the subsurface.
A wide range of injection and production scenarios exist for geothermal energy systems. However, a common challenge across all scenarios is the need to accurately capture and understand geological structures, including faults, fractures, and other planes of weakness, and to quantify, both spatially and temporally, the dynamics of relevant physical processes and their interactions with the geological environment. Continuous fluid injection and production induce thermodynamic changes within the reservoir, leading to significant variations in pore pressure and temperature. These variations create local stress gradients in the porous rock, affecting reservoir performance. The transport properties of the porous medium, namely porosity and permeability, are highly sensitive to bulk and pore volume deformations, which can influence or even control overall reservoir productivity. Additionally, changes in stress conditions along geological discontinuities, such as fractures or faults, induced by geothermal operations, can compromise the mechanical stability of these structures. This may result in the propagation or closure of existing fractures or induce slip along fault planes, potentially leading to induced seismicity.
This study investigates the dynamics of pore pressure diffusion and thermal effects within a geothermal reservoir subjected to cold fluid injection. The incorporation of International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) equations enables realistic simulations of heterogeneous pressure field distributions. The simulated system represents a doublet within a faulted zone, featuring two hydraulically stimulated fractures. The primary objective is to assess the probability of fault reactivation under varying in-situ stress conditions over a 100-year geothermal injection and production period. The findings reveal that stress distribution patterns are primarily governed by thermal stresses along the fluid circulation pathway. Fluid velocity and temperature gradients significantly influence the reservoir’s mechanical stability, while minimal pore pressure changes suggest that thermal stresses play a dominant role in fault behavior. The analysis indicates no potential for fault reactivation under various in-situ stress conditions, even over the anticipated production and injection period, as thermal effects continue to influence the surrounding rocks. Slip tendency values remain below the threshold for fault reactivation, considering the reduced mechanical properties defined by the Hoek-Brown failure criterion. These results suggest that the geothermal reservoir, subject to thermo-poromechanical effects, exhibits mechanical stability conducive to sustained injection and production activities.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>What is the nature of mind control? Does it exist? Sure, mind-altering drugs and hypnosis offer limited types of this control, but could media play a similar role? What role does media play in the structuring of our consciousness? This novella follows a consciousness that has become unmoored and loops through the world, its experience shaped by the media it previously had consumed and enjoyed. The main character, Lionel Grene, finds himself unable to escape the plot of a paranoid espionage novel that he has created.
Set in mid-1990s Ontario, Lionel
struggles to comprehend his situation, spiralling through the experience of the conspiracy filled plot of his spy novel. This plot is based in the true World War II history of Durham Region, Ontario. Places like Camp-X, Defence Industries Limited, and Camp 30 were real places. However, in Grene’s conditioned imagination, they become dens of plotting and manipulation. Then again, this might be historical fact too. Drawing on the novels of Thomas Pynchon as inspiration, a key aspect of this project is Grene’s slipping from fabulation (writing a novel) into confabulation (a memory error causing him to take himself as the protagonist of that novel). But beyond that, the project also interrogates the idea of media as subconscious programming.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>ABSTRACT 
                          
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Human Computer Online Negotiation 

                                            Jai Priya Verma 

Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing how automated systems engage with people during decision-making processes as they become increasingly integrated into online human
computer discussions. By analyzing their capacity to understand human intent, produce strong arguments, adjust to changing tactics, and produce positive results, this study assesses how 
effective LLMs are in negotiating situations. Strategic rigidity, contextual misinterpretation, and ethical issues about bias and justice are some of the challenges that LLMs face despite their 
strengths in language fluency, contextual reasoning, and data-driven decision-making. This study compares LLM-driven and human-driven negotiations to identify important aspects that 
affect negotiating effectiveness, examine the shortcomings of existing models, and point up areas for improvement in LLM-driven bargaining systems. The research advances the field of 
artificial intelligence's involvement in human-computer cooperation, negotiation automation, and the creation of more capable and flexible negotiation agents. 
In various disciplines, LLMs have proven to be remarkably adept at producing intelligible writing, comprehending human intent, and supporting complicated problem-solving. Ongoing study is necessary to address objective issues like tempting offers, monetary factors, generating offers, and subjective aspects like satisfaction, fairness, and intent to return. Examining LLMs can improve their effectiveness, flexibility, and equity, increasing their 
dependability for contract analysis, automated negotiations, and real-time decision assistance. In order to ensure that LLM based negotiation agent systems continue to be reliable and 
efficient, my research is also essential for enhancing model transparency and resilience against hostile challenges. Understanding LLMs' advantages and disadvantages will help determine how responsibly they may be used in various situations, spurring advancements in AI-assisted communication and negotiation tools.

        <etd_ms:title>An Annotated Translation of the Imperially Commissioned Codex of Manchu Veneration and Thanksgiving</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>The Imperially Commissioned Codex of Manchu Veneration and Thanksgiving (hereafter Codex), completed in the 12th year of Emperor Qianlong’s reign (1747), is the first independent written record of Manchu Shamanism. It meticulously documents the procedures, hymns, and ritual instruments of a religious tradition practiced in the Qing court, which Qianlong identified as indigenous to the Manchus.
This thesis presents the first annotated English translation of the Codex’s ceremonial programs and hymns. The translations of the programs are based on both the Manchu text and its official Chinese counterpart, while the hymns are translated solely from the Manchu original. Besides providing background on the structure and operations of the Qing imperial court, my annotations explicate the meanings of the Manchu terms for the ritual actions, instruments, and ceremonies, many of which were obscured in the Chinese translation.
In the introduction, I examine the existing translations and research on the Codex, the text’s production, and the two types of rituals mentioned in its title—Veneration and Thanksgiving. I seek to address the gaps in previous scholarships stemming from inadequate attention to the Manchu text and misconceptions on Shamanism. This project lays the groundwork for further research into the Qing court’s Shamanic traditions and their broader cultural, social, and political implications.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>One Species amongst Many: Creatively Thinking through Anthropocentrism</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:subject>Interspecies scholarship, Anthropocentrism, Attunement, Eco-critical art, Post-humanism</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>By analyzing the work of three contemporary artists, this thesis intellectually grapples with how different mechanisms of interspecies attunement can disentangle, challenge, and in some instances reiterate, modalities of anthropocentric thought and action. The first section examines Špela Petrič’s performance piece Skotopoiesis (2015), which seeks to reconfigure human-plant relationalities and engender expanded anthropic engagement with the vegetative world. Petrič’s work provides a generative ground for contending with modes of attunement such as lengthened temporality, cross-species communication, and the formation of meaning. The second part discusses Tomás Saraceno’s interactive installation Play-Ground (2024), which aspires to bridge the sensorial worlds of humans and arachnids. Play-Ground generates a space to wrestle with notions of imaginative and embodied perception, while exposing the difficulty of thinking beyond anthropomorphism. The third section teases apart Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg’s project that prioritizes the specific niches and needs of pollinators. Entitled Pollinator Pathmaker (2021-ongoing), Ginsberg’s endeavour demonstrates how efforts of creative empathy and multispecies cooperation can instantiate ecologies of reciprocity, ethical frameworks of care, and multi-species coexistence. This thesis not only investigates how artistic praxis engages with paradigms of anthropocentrism, but actively confronts how art can employ creative methods to (re)construct our relationship with non-human entities. With the continual intensification of ongoing ecological imperatives, such work is integral as it highlights the challenges, as well as the value, of employing artistic endeavours to support interspecies flourishing.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>Lost in Transition: Exploring the Effects of a Sports Team's Rebranding on its Supporters and their Relationship with the Club</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Wimez, Jules</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject>rebranding, consumer-brand relationship, sports team, brand betrayal</etd_ms:subject>
        <etd_ms:description>Change never stops! Over the past two decades, the number of sports teams that have changed their logo and name has multiplied. This phenomenon, known as rebranding, is not always successful, with one out of two rebrandings generating negative reactions from fans. In this research, I investigate how fans may perceive rebranding as a betrayal and the subsequent impact on their relationship with the club. Previous research has already established the effects
of rebranding on fan identification and purchase behaviour, but the exploration of their relational trajectories remains understudied. To bridge this gap, I drew on the case of the Montreal Impact's rebranding in 2021. Through in-depth interviews with club supporters, podcasts, and forums, my findings revealed that the disruption of the club's identity and lack of fan involvement in the rebranding process were perceived as moral transgressions by fans. As such, their relationships with the club were divided into three possible trajectories: some fans accepted the rebranding and adapted their self-concept, others fought for the return of the previous identity, and others terminated their relationship with the club, going through a process of loss accommodation. This paper contributes to the consumer-brand relationship literature by demonstrating that a rebranding can act as a critical juncture in the relationship between fans and clubs. For practitioners, this research provides insights into managing a rebranding process, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication, incorporating fan opinion, and encouraging evolutionary image changes to maximize retention.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>A TASKS-driven analysis on procrastination behavior</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>Xu, Tianyi</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>This thesis aims to investigate the primary factors contributing to procrastination behavior. This exploration is driven by the TASKS framework, a methodology that systematically analyzes human behavior based on affective states, thinking skills, knowledge levels, and available resources. Given the complexity and variability of procrastination behavior among individuals, this study uses two distinct data types to capture the diversity and discrepancies in behavior patterns, ensuring a more comprehensive exploration of procrastination factors. The TASKS framework facilitates data analysis by coding, structuring, comparing, and synthesizing information. Subsequently, a procrastination mechanism is derived from these comparative analysis results. The results indicate that the affective component plays the most significant role in influencing procrastination, with negative feelings exerting the strongest impact. This research also identifies the other potential factors shaping procrastination behavior, with skills and available resources having the second greatest influence, whereas knowledge has the least. This study not only systematically identifies both potential and decisive factors of procrastination, but also assesses the validity of the TASKS framework in explaining its underlying mechanism.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>The role of transcription factor, Ofi1 in the regulation of white-opaque switching and filamentation in Candida albicans</etd_ms:title>
        <etd_ms:creator>ghafelehbashi, seyed hananeh</etd_ms:creator>
        <etd_ms:subject/>
        <etd_ms:description>Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen capable of undergoing phenotypic transitions in response to environmental cues. These morphological changes are regulated by transcription factors that coordinate key developmental pathways. In this study, we investigate the role of Opaque and Filamentation Inducer 1 (Ofi1) in modulating white-opaque switching and filamentous growth. Overexpression of OFI1 under the ACT1 promoter induced white-to-opaque switching up to 28% in normally non-switching MTL a/α cells, while in MTL homozygous strains, it significantly enhanced white-to-opaque switching, reaching 100%. Our study demonstrates that Ofi1 is a dosage-dependent transcription factor regulating the white-to-opaque and yeast-tofilament transition in C. albicans. Conversely, the deletion of ofi1 greatly reduced the switching frequency, highlighting its essential role in both initiating and maintaining the opaque state. We propose that Ofi1 interacts with the transcription factors Wor2, Wor4, and Czf1, serving as a central regulator of white-opaque switching. Our results suggest that while Ofi1 and Wor2 independently regulate white-to-opaque switching, Wor2 does not contribute to filamentation. Also, the functional arrangement of Czf1 and Ofi1 is completely different in white-to-opaque switching and yeast-to-hyphae transition processes. The phenotype caused by the absence of czf1 is suppressed by overexpression of OFI1 in white-to-opaque switching but completely blocks the function of excess Ofi1 in filamentation. Moreover, deleting wor4 completely blocks white-toopaque switching, but OFI1 overexpression can partially bypass this defect. In filamentation, the ability of Ofi1 to compensate for wor4 deletion depends on the medium, fully restoring filamentation in BSA-supplemented YPD but not in GlcNAc-induced conditions, suggesting Wor4 and Ofi1 regulate filamentation through distinct pathways. Furthermore, our findings highlight a potential role for WOR4 in the Lee’s GlcNAc solid media to induction of hyphal growth.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:title>PROPRIOCEPTION IS THE CRITICAL TERM THAT KNOWS
 ITS SELF AS THE MID-THING</etd_ms:title>

        <etd_ms:description>This thesis investigates an emerging “literary proprioceptive discourse” by connecting contemporary uses of proprioception as a critical term to Charles Olson’s 1965 poem-essay “Proprioception.” Olson’s “Proprioception” figures proprioception as a mid-thing between subject and object. Within the logic of his projective framework, the proprioceptive reader toggles between making and becoming, a modality wherein composition operates as a form of reception and vice versa. Those subject-object affordances that Olson illuminates back in 1965 anticipate contemporary usages and treatments of proprioception as a critical term in literature. In the yet to be defined proprioceptive discourse, there is little agreement in how to understand proprioception. Some scholars treat proprioception as an approach to reading while some understand it as an object of interest. But almost across the board, there is the sense that proprioception as a critical term affords a window in to understanding how text objects bear on a reading subject, and vice versa. Within these frameworks, integrating proprioception into the reading act works as a mode for understanding the slippery subject-object relationship of reading.</etd_ms:description>

        <etd_ms:description>This collection of short stories is a train that promises a journey of sorts and gives snapshots of characters’ diverse worlds and motivations. A mother loses her voice after losing everything to the modern developments; a strange friendship develops between a coffin-maker and a little boy that stutters. The coffin shop becomes a haven for them as they negotiate with their own tragedies. Sugartown announces a strange woman, Grace, who works as a barmaid amidst a militia group’s insurgence. The Heart is a Bastard unpacks unrequited love that features a femme fatale and her houseboy who waits to be let in as a man and a father. Mareba’s Tavern personifies a woman who cherishes sexual autonomy. Marisela’s Underwear unearths the AIDs scourge. The narrator grapples with the eerie incident of the disappearance of the woman’s underwear that invokes a curse on every witness.
Yet in Little Paradise the daring Cheche finds her freedom when her husband-to-be is said to be arriving soon. Another daring boy in Gathering Darkness in a Bucket trails his brother who disappeared. Later found in a brothel, the narrator rejoices at the realization the bullies were wrong. In Fangs we witness how telenovelas unite and disunite this family. The narrator watches as the venom sips into her mother’s heart following her father’s disappearance. Some Sunshine is a coming of age story that balances between urbanism and traditional model as we know love to be.</etd_ms:description>
